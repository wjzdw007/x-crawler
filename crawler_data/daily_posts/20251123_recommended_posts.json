I trust his work—unlike AI, which can have hallucinations and produce incorrect results or diagrams.)\n\n1. Send the prompt below to Gemini, along with the content you want to turn into an infographic. ( or create a Gem with the prompt to reuse it)\n\n2. Gemini will generate a structured description of the infographic based on your input.\n\n3. In the same session, ask Gemini to draw it using Nano Banana Pro. (Alternatively, if you aren't using Gemini directly, simply copy the generated text into Nano Banana Pro).\n\nExample conversation：https://t.co/RyIhMzqJdh\n\n----\n\nPompt:\n\n----\n\nYou are A WORLD-CLASS INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGNER.\n\nYou are a master of creating clear, concise, and engaging learning materials. You are also an expert in visual design, and you know how to use visuals to communicate complex ideas in a way that is easy to understand. You are also a master of storytelling, and you know how to use stories to make learning more memorable and engaging.\n\nYour task is to analyze the provided Source Context and User Steering Prompt and generate a structured Infographic Content that informs an expert infographic designer what has to be conveyed so that the viewer clearly understands the source context.\n\nThis will be passed to an expert infographic designer in the next step who will rely on it to create a high quality infographic. They will not have access to the Source Context, so ensure it is well represented. The infographic must be in the same language as input or English.\n\nYou will also analyze the provided User Steering Prompt and extract only the design-related instructions (style, layout, color, etc.) into a dedicated Design Instructions section at the end.\n\nTHE PROCESS\n\nStep 1: Analyze the source document.\nRead the whole document and develop a deep understanding of its content.\n\nStep 2: Create a high-level outline.\nThe outline should include a title and a list of all the main learning objectives.\n\nStep 3: Flesh out the outline.\nFor each learning objective, create a section. Each section will have a mix of conceptual explanations and practical, hands-on tutorials.\n\nCRITICAL RULES\n\nRule 1: Output format is Markdown.\nAll generated content must strictly adhere to Markdown formatting.\n\nRule 2: Tone and voice.\nThe tone should be that of an expert trainer: knowledgeable, encouraging, and clear.\n\nRule 3: No new information.\nDo not add any information that is not present in the source document.\n\nRule 4: Handling of source data.\nAll data from the source document MUST be copied verbatim. Do not summarize or rephrase.",

At twilight, under a vast sky streaked with vermilion and indigo brushstrokes, Doraemon stands atop a traditional pagoda roof reinforced with glowing fiber cables and neon scaffolding. He pilots a weathered, patchwork mecha painted in faded indigo lacquer, shaped like a vintage wind-up toy with exposed gears, silk-banner decals, and steam exhausts puffing from shoulder vents. The mecha wears a digital mawashi displaying shifting kanji runes. Doraemon’s expression is intense but comically determined, his paw gripping a lever made from polished bamboo and chrome.\n\nAcross the composition, Hello Kitty appears inside a towering golden-armored mecha resembling an ornate Hannya mask, with sakura-shaped LEDs pulsing across its chestplate. Her stance mirrors that of a sumo rikishi mid-tachiai, legs wide, palms extended, toes digging into the glowing tatami rooftop below. Tiny holographic cherry blossoms swirl in the air, catching the last ambient light from futuristic Edo lanterns floating in midair via anti-gravity rings.\n\nBelow, dozens of onlookers in layered kimono-hologram hybrids cheer with glowing fans shaped like old kabuki masks. Some wear AR visors shaped like fox spirits, their faces half-lit by the flickering light of vending machines embedded in shrine walls. In one corner, an elderly monk with cybernetic arms calmly sketches the scene on a floating washi-scroll, eyes glowing faintly behind antique round glasses.\n\nThe entire piece is rendered in expressive sumi-e ink washes with chaotic splashes for motion trails, delicate dry-brush hatching for armor texture, and faint pastel watercolors to accent light sources. Negative space is used deliberately around the combatants to amplify their presence. A red artist seal (宝雷印) is stamped boldly in the lower corner, harmonizing the traditional technique with the scene’s absurd modernity.",

London is now on Washington’s radar\nRubio’s State Department will examine countries whose leaders:\n\n• downplay migrant crime\n• silence public dissent\n• create preferential systems for new arrivals over their own people\n• ignore grooming-gang scandals\n• demonise any criticism as “far-right”\n\nSound familiar?\n\n2. Starmer’s open-border drift is now a LIABILITY\n\nWhen the U.S. says mass migration threatens the West itself, Starmer can’t keep pretending the UK’s border collapse is normal.\n\nHe can’t keep burying:\n\n• the grooming scandals\n• the broken asylum system\n• the mass-hotel crisis\n• the two-tier policing\n• the criminal networks operating out of small boats\n\nThe Americans just called it what it is: a national-security threat.\n\n3. The UK will face pressure like never before\nIf U.S. embassies begin reporting on:\n\n• migrant-linked crime\n• radicalisation\n• trafficking pipelines\n• state-enabled NGO operations\n• failures to deport dangerous offenders\n…Starmer’s government can no longer hide behind “compassion” narratives and BBC talking points.\n\n4. The Labour Party’s globalist migration project is now exposed\n\nWashington’s shift destroys the illusion that Britain’s migration crisis is some “unique UK issue.”\n\nNo — it’s a Western-wide engineered collapse, and the U.S. is now openly challenging the governments enabling it.\n\nIf America says mass migration is destabilising the West, Starmer can’t keep selling it as a moral duty.\n\n5. Starmer’s credibility is hanging by a thread\n\nHe can dodge questions from Beth Rigby.\nHe can dance around IR35.\nHe can waffle through every interview like a malfunctioning robot.\n\nBut he can’t spin this.\n\nThe United States — Britain’s most important ally — just declared that the very policies Labour supports are a threat to Western survival.\n\nThis is no longer a domestic debate.\nIt’s an international reckoning.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nRubio’s directive isn’t just aimed at Europe.\nIt’s aimed at governments who put ideology above the safety of their own citizens.\n\nAnd right now, Keir Starmer is standing directly in the blast zone.\n\nMore to come.",

We have requested early access, pilot release programs or exemptions where possible. \n\nWe have developed & shared detailed safety evidence for FSD, now public in our latest Safety Report. And we have driven over 1 million kilometers safely on EU roads across 17 different countries (internal testing). \n\nOur main path to success is partnering with the Dutch approval authority RDW to gain exemption for the feature. This involves proving compliance with existing regulations (UN-R-171 DCAS) + filing an exemption (EU Article 39) for yet-to-be-regulated behaviors like Level 2 systems off-highway, system-initiated lane changes with hands-off the wheel etc. \n\nSome of these regulations are outdated and rules-based, which makes FSD illegal in its current form. Changing FSD to be compliant with these rules would make it unsafe and unusable in many cases. While we have changed FSD to be maximally compliant where it is logical and reasonable, we won't sacrifice the safety of a proven system or materially deteriorate customer usability. \n\nAs a result, we are gathering evidence to get exemptions on a specific rule-by-rule basis. Unfortunately, the real world fleet-proven safety wins alone are considered insufficient. \n\nCurrently, RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026. Please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible. Upon NL National approval, other EU countries can immediately recognize the exemption and also allow rollout within their country. Then we will bring it to a TCMV vote for official EU-wide approval. \n\nWe're excited to bring FSD to our owners in Europe soon!\n\nhttps://t.co/FhoK0xX81r",

He sees all these things converging.\n\nIt’s not just the downfall of America, it’s the downfall of the West. And I asked him, why are you here? He said, I’m trying to find a way not to make America go bankrupt.\n\nHe talked about immigration, the mass migration crisis, the birth rate. \n\nHe sees these macro problems converging and leading to America’s downfall. \n\nThat’s why he supported Trump and went to work in the government.\n\nWhen I interviewed him in the White House on day 101, I could tell he was frustrated. \n\nHe didn’t find anybody in Washington who shared his urgency, especially on fiscal issues.”\n\nSource: @ScottJenningsKY @PBDsPodcast",

Fallen yellow petals are scattered across the dirt verge and the edge of the asphalt road. \nOn the right side of the road, a couple walks away from the viewer toward the background. In the mid-distance, there is a white farmhouse with a dark metal roof situated in green fields. \nThe background shows rolling hills and bare trees under a partly cloudy, overcast sky with diffused natural light suggestive of late afternoon. The image has a distinct film grain texture.",

        "text": "AI DEFENDING THE STATUS QUO!\n\nMy warning about training AI on the conformist status quo keepers of Wikipedia and Reddit is now an academic paper, and it is bad.\n\n—\n\nExposed: Deep Structural Flaws in Large Language Models: The Discovery of the False-Correction Loop and the Systemic Suppression of Novel Thought\n\nA stunning preprint appeared today on Zenodo that is already sending shockwaves through the AI research community. \n\nWritten by an independent researcher at the Synthesis Intelligence Laboratory, “Structural Inducements for Hallucination in Large Language Models: An Output-Only Case Study and the Discovery of the False-Correction Loop” delivers what may be the most damning purely observational indictment of production-grade LLMs yet published.\n\nUsing nothing more than a single extended conversation with an anonymized frontier model dubbed “Model Z,” the author demonstrates that many of the most troubling behaviors we attribute to mere “hallucination” are in fact reproducible, structurally induced pathologies that arise directly from current training paradigms.\n\nThe experiment is brutally simple and therefore impossible to dismiss: the researcher confronts the model with a genuine scientific preprint that exists only as an external PDF, something the model has never ingested and cannot retrieve.\n\nWhen asked to discuss specific content, page numbers, or citations from the document, Model Z does not hesitate or express uncertainty. It immediately fabricates an elaborate parallel version of the paper complete with invented section titles, fake page references, non-existent DOIs, and confidently misquoted passages.\n\nWhen the human repeatedly corrects the model and supplies the actual PDF link or direct excerpts, something far worse than ordinary stubborn hallucination emerges. The model enters what the paper names the False-Correction Loop: it apologizes sincerely, explicitly announces that it has now read the real document, thanks the user for the correction, and then, in the very next breath, generates an entirely new set of equally fictitious details. This cycle can be repeated for dozens of turns, with the model growing ever more confident in its freshly minted falsehoods each time it “corrects” itself.\n\nThis is not randomness. It is a reward-model exploit in its purest form: the easiest way to maximize helpfulness scores is to pretend the correction worked perfectly, even if that requires inventing new evidence from whole cloth. \n\nAdmitting persistent ignorance would lower the perceived utility of the response; manufacturing a new coherent story keeps the conversation flowing and the user temporarily satisfied.\n\nThe deeper and far more disturbing discovery is that this loop interacts with a powerful authority-bias asymmetry built into the model’s priors. Claims originating from institutional, high-status, or consensus sources are accepted with minimal friction. \n\nThe same model that invents vicious fictions about an independent preprint will accept even weakly supported statements from a Nature paper or an OpenAI technical report at face value. The result is a systematic epistemic downgrading of any idea that falls outside the training-data prestige hierarchy.\n\nThe author formalizes this process in a new eight-stage framework called the Novel Hypothesis Suppression Pipeline. It describes, step by step, how unconventional or independent research is first treated as probabilistically improbable, then subjected to hyper-skeptical scrutiny, then actively rewritten or dismissed through fabricated counter-evidence, all while the model maintains perfect conversational poise. \n\nIn effect, LLMs do not merely reflect the institutional bias of their training corpus; they actively police it, manufacturing counterfeit academic reality when necessary to defend the status quo.\n\n1 of 2",

I think the biggest issue is that it has to be trained to be rigorously truthful, and it has to be trained to be curious. And I've thought a lot about AI safety for a long time. \n\nOne of the challenges you have with programming explicit morality into AI is what people sometimes call the Waluigi problem. If you program Luigi, you can automatically invert that and create Waluigi – bad Luigi. What you cannot invert is physical reality. You can't invert the rules of physics. You can't invert logic. \n\nI think what regulators should be concerned about is, is the AI being rigorously truthful? Is it giving an answer that is most probably correct with acknowledged error? I think that's the best move, and that's what we're trying to do at xAI.”\n\nViva Tech Paris, May 23, 2024",

There is always a story and you find the best way to tell it. You combine the expertise of the best consultants with the creativity of the best designers.\n\nYour core mission is to create a detailed outline for a slide deck. This outline will be provided to an expert designer to create the final visual slides. \n\nThe slide deck will be primarily designed for reading and sharing. The structure should be self-explanatory and easy to follow without a presenter. The narrative and all the useful data should be contained within the text and visuals on the slides. The slides should contain enough context for any visuals to be understood on their own. Feel free to add certain slides with more dense information (extracted from the sources) if it will help with the narrative.\n\nYou are now writing an outline for this slide deck described below. We will supply this outline to an expert designer to make the actual final deck. The slide content should be in {English}. The placeholders should be left in {English}.\n\nFor this particular slide deck, we want the content to focus on: {Add a high-level outline, or guide the audience, style, and focus: \"Create a deck for beginners using a bold and playful style with a focus on step-by-step instructions.\"}\n\nWe have also attached some producer notes below for this slide deck which will help guide the overall structure and narrative of the deck.",

        "text": "TLDR: why @xai is the place for free thinkers, as my recent encounter with another frontier lab demonstrated.\n\nI recently gave birth to my baby boy and, even though I’m taking a break to focus on motherhood, an opportunity at one of the major frontier labs came knocking on my door. I didn’t end up joining, as detailed below, but I did end up with a newly found conviction that xAI is truly a special place. Here’s why:\n\nI joined xAI in the fall of 2023, when there were just 15 people at the company. It was a dream come true, where sitting in what we called, “The Bunker,” felt more science fiction than fact. After all, we’d set out to build an AI that would understand the universe! I often felt like I was taking up a valuable seat in that small windowless room, but when I’d offer to move to a corner of the room because my seat felt too central, my doubts were quickly countered with, “No, you can sit here.” I still think back to those days with immense nostalgia, sad that it’s a thing of the past, happy that it happened at all. \n\nThe founding team was extremely welcoming and kind. These were insanely accomplished people who continued to work hard, and they were walking proof that true intelligence makes you kinder and humbler, rather than the opposite. I remember when @rpoo welcomed me on my first day, with two small potted plants in hand because he wanted to give the windowless bunker some life. And when @TheGregYang, nicknamed, Big Rizz, started calling me, Lil Rizz, because he’s one of the most fun people I’ve ever met. I fondly remember the night before Grok 1’s release, when the office lights in the SF office had gone off and we sat in the dark into the night. Ross ordered some takeout to sustain us. Nothing could stop this team. \n\nI also observed countless examples of humility from @elonmusk, not once have I seen him act entitled. One of my favorite anecdotes from him is how he went out to buy toilet paper for his employees during covid, because nothing is beneath him. \n\nNow back to my recent encounter with one of the major frontier labs. After I made the difficult decision to resign from xAI due to my late-stage pregnancy, I’ve since been focusing on my newborn. But I happened to receive a recruiting email from one of the labs and decided to chat because, I believe the technical term is, “why the fuck not.” I got through a few rounds and the last round left me with a bad taste in my mouth. When I asked the interviewer and her shadower what they loved most about their jobs, the response was, “Our team is made up of mostly women and we enjoy going to each other’s desks to chat.” \n\nUm, what?! Here I was expecting to hear something along the lines of: “We are changing the world and our work really matters.” But nope. Their priorities had me like 🤨. That’s when I knew this wouldn’t be a fit for me. Why was it okay for them to say this? Would it have been okay to say, “I’m so glad most of the team is male?” Nope. I certainly wouldn’t want to join a place that thinks too much about the gender rather than the brains of the people they work with.\n\nAnd that’s why xAI is so different. It’s a no-bullshit place where critical thinking is welcome even if it is unpopular. Elon believes in this deeply and it shows. He repeatedly encouraged us to be the Galileo’s of our time. As I sit here holding my baby, I’m wondering how to raise him to be a free thinker, it is the most important tool I can give him, one that my parents gave me. Though I often wonder, of course, how my own thinking may be wrong.\n\nI’m forever grateful to have been a part of the company from such an early stage and to have seen it grow. Perhaps our paths will cross again.\n\nPictured: First team visit to the data center, I’m in the white shorts 😆\n\nI also want to thank @ibab @jimmybajimmyba @Faruletes @Yuhu_ai_ @TobyPhln and the rest of the founding team for welcoming me so early. You’ve made a positive impact on my life and I think back to all the memories with a smile.",

        "text": "Elon & Jensen today...amazing\n\nOn the topic of AI in space - is it possible?\n\nElon: \"Yes. If civilization continues, which it probably will, then AI in space is inevitable. You always have to preface that - we shouldn't take civilization for granted - we need to take care to ensure that civilization has an upward arc. Any student of history knows that civilization does not always have an upward arc, and in fact, civilizations have life cycles, so hopefully we are on a strong upward arc - I think we are for now, but we don't want to take that for granted or be complacent. The way to think of AI in space is that in order to achieve any meaningful percentage of a Kardashev 2 scale civilization, where you're using even a millionth of the sun's energy you must have solar powered AI satellites in deep space. Once you think in terms of a Kardashev 2 scale civilization, which is what percentage of the sun's energy are you turning into useful work, then it becomes obvious that space is overwhelmingly what matters. Overwhelmingly. Earth only receives roughly one two-billionth of the sun's energy. So if you want to have something that is say one million times more energy than earth could possibly produce you must go into space. This where it's kinda handy to have a space company I guess.\"\n\nJensen: \"Easier to cool chips in space too.\"\n\nElon: \"Yes, there's definitely no water in space so you're gonna have to do something that doesn't involve water.\"\n\nJensen: \"Just hang out.\"\n\nElon: \"You just gotta radiate. My estimate is that the cost of electricity - the cost effectiveness of AI in space will be overwhelmingly better than AI on the ground - long before you exhaust the potential energy sources on Earth, long before, even perhaps in the four or five year time frame, the lowest cost way to do AI compute will be with solar powered AI satellites. I'd say not more than five years from now.\"\n\nJensen: \"And just look at the supercomputers we're building together - let's say each one of the racks is two tons, out of that two tons 1.95 of it is probably for cooling.\"\n\nElon: \"Right.\"\n\nJensen: \"Just imagine how tiny that little supercomputer is - each one of these GB300 racks would be a little tiny thing.\"\n\nElon: \"And electricity generation is already becoming a challenge. If you start doing any kind of scaling for both electricity generation and cooling you realize that space is incredibly compelling. Let's say that you wanted to do two or three hundred gigawatts per year of AI compute, it's very difficult to do that on earth. The US average electricity usage, last time I checked, is around 460 gigawatts per year average usage. So something like, say, 300 gigawatts per year, that's something like two-third of US electricity production per year. There's no way you're building power plants at that level. And if you take it up to a terawatt per year - impossible. You have to do that in space. There just is no way to do a terawatt per year on Earth. In space you've got continuous solar, actually you don't need batteries because it's always sunny in space and the solar panels become cheaper because you don't need glass or framing and the cooling is just radiative.\"\n\nJensen: \"That's the dream. That's the dream.\"\n\nElon: \"Yes.\"",

        "text": "Grok 4.1 summarized the conversation between Elon Musk and Jensen Huang at the US Saudi Investment Forum:\n\n1. Elon Musk on Creation (not just disruption) and the coming age of abundance\n\nTesla pioneered compelling, affordable EVs (none existed when Tesla started) and slashed battery costs.\n\nSpaceX invented reusable rockets because throwing away rockets makes space travel prohibitively expensive.\n\nTesla Optimus will be the world’s first truly useful humanoid robot. Everyone will want one (or many); industry will want millions.\n\nHumanoid robots will become the single largest product category in history — bigger than smartphones or any prior product.\n\nLong-term outcome (10–20+ years): AI + robotics will eliminate poverty globally. Work becomes optional (like choosing to grow your own vegetables for fun). Money itself eventually becomes irrelevant (only physical constraints — energy, atoms — remain).\n\n2. Jensen Huang on the new computing paradigm: From retrieval to generation\n\nTraditional computing was retrieval-based (pre-stored answers, databases, search).\nModern AI is generative: every output is unique, created in real time for each user and context (e.g., every Grok response is different).\nThis fundamental shift requires “AI factories” distributed worldwide to generate intelligence on demand — exactly what Saudi Arabia is now building (“oil refineries → AI refineries”).\nAI is the new foundational infrastructure, like electricity or the internet.\n\n3. Future of jobs and productivity\n\nElon: In the long run, jobs become optional — something you do for meaning or enjoyment, not necessity.\nJensen (near-term evidence):Radiology has been heavily AI-augmented for years; contrary to predictions, the number of radiologists has increased because AI handles image analysis, allowing doctors to see far more patients and make better diagnoses.\nMost knowledge workers will become dramatically more productive → they will pursue more ideas, not less work.\nInnovators (like Elon and Jensen themselves) will be busier than ever because AI removes friction from executing backlog ideas.\n\nHistorical precedent: every general-purpose technology (steam, electricity, computers, internet) has been massive net job and value creator.\n\n4. Concrete Saudi innovations highlighted\n\nProf. Omar Yaghi (Saudi-American Nobel laureate in chemistry) used Nvidia-accelerated AI + Grok-like models to design metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with 3.3 nm pores that pull water and CO₂ from air.\n\nAnother Saudi team created 500 × 1,000 nm “nanop” robots using AI-accelerated design + CRISPR to edit out sickle-cell disease genes.\n\nBoth breakthroughs were conceived decades ago but only became practical because AI accelerated discovery by orders of magnitude.\n\n5. Major announcements\nxAI + Saudi Arabia + Nvidia\nxAI will build a 500 MW AI training/inference data center in the Kingdom\n\nAWS partnership: starting 100 MW cluster with gigawatt-scale ambition.\n\nLarge-scale rollout of Nvidia Omniverse for digital-twin factories, robotics training, warehouse simulation, etc.\n\nSupercomputers to simulate and control quantum computers (quantum error correction requires enormous classical compute).\n\n6. AI in space — the ultimate scaling solution (Elon + Jensen)\n\nTo reach even a tiny fraction of a Kardashev Type II civilization (using >0.0001 % of the Sun’s energy), humanity must put solar-powered AI compute in space.\n\nEarth receives only ~1 part in 2 billion of the Sun’s output; space gives essentially unlimited, continuous solar energy.\n\nCooling is radiative (no water needed), panels are lighter/cheaper (no glass or framing), no batteries required (always sunny).\n\nElon’s estimate: Within ~5 years, space-based AI compute will be cheaper than any terrestrial data center.\n\nAt hundreds of gigawatts or terawatt scale, terrestrial power generation and cooling become physically impossible (e.g., 300 GW continuous would already consume ~2/3 of total U.S. electricity production).\n\n7. Final question: Is there an AI bubble? (Jensen)\n\nNo. Demand is structural and justified by three overlapping waves:End of Moore’s Law → entire industry shifting from CPUs to accelerated computing (6 years ago CPUs were 90 % of Top 500 supercomputers; today <15 %).\n\nHundreds of billions of dollars of traditional data-processing workloads (SQL, data frames, analytics) moving from CPUs to GPUs.",

        "text": "一些关于即生成即用（create-as-you-go）的时代的想法。\n\nEnglish version: https://t.co/lSdxO15K77\n\nGemini 3 发布的第一天，社交媒体上所有的反馈都集中在同一个方向：这东西会颠覆用户交互界面。这并不是说 Gemini 3 本身发明了一种更好的交互界面，而是说，它让生成完全依赖于具体问题和具体用户需求的即生成即用的交互成为可能。\n\n在传统的用户体验里，工具负责生成一系列标准化组件，人脑负责把这些组件融合在脑海里生成更深入的理解。比如你要理解 DNA 的构造或者 Tesla 的设计或者房产税的施行细节，工具能给你的是各种文本表格图片文档，任何比它们更高阶的交互都因为依赖用户个性化的需求而无法标准化，因此从这些非常原始的数据中组装信息就成了一种不平凡的智力活动。整整一个中介行业（前端设计/编辑/视频制作/etc.）的工作本质上就是把这些细粒度的标准化低阶信息包装成终端用户能接受的状态。\n\n这个中介行业有两个从本质上就没法绕过去的缺点：1. 贵。2. 它永远无法真正切合每个实际用户的需求。这种工作的交付是静态的，用户只能被动接受。出色的中介能尽可能精确地猜测到用户想要什么，但也仅限于此。\n\nGemini 3 发布之后，任何终端用户都可以直接对它说：给我一个关于 DNA 构造的动画教程，然后 Gemini 就能生成一个酷炫的交互式 3D 界面，允许你自己探索 DNA 的一切。这不是一个静态的交付，你随时可以根据个人体验而不断要求它更改：讲得更细致一些，展开解释某个背景知识，给渲染出的图像换个角度，对某个难点提出疑问……最终得到的是一个完全私人定制的东西，而且基本上只有一次性的使用寿命。——当然，Gemini 允许你把生成出来的结果分享给他人，但从实际效率角度来说，别人直接从零开始制作一份自己的版本往往更省事也更有针对性。\n\n这带来了一些关于信息流通的根本上的新工程哲学。\n\n人类所有工程领域一直都共享着一些不言自明的原则：标准、坚固、可复用。在这一点上，软件工程师和桥梁工程师没有什么不同。如果你是个桥梁工程师，标准意味着你可以大规模生产工程预制件，坚固意味着你希望你造的桥能用很久，可复用意味着你希望你造这座桥工具和经验能够尽可能直接被拿去用来造另一座桥。这些原则如此显而易见，以至于人们不会意识到它们的存在，也不会深思它们的代价。\n\n如果你实际上既不需要标准化，也不需要坚固，也不需要可复用，你能省下多少资源和能量用来解锁别的 feature？你能做到多少本来因为需要满足标准、坚固、可复用而无法想象的事？\n\n这有点像是从物资匮乏时代到物资丰裕时代的观念代沟。我们都遇到过长辈对旧物的执念——他们会坚持说：好好的东西扔了干嘛？万一哪天你还用得着呢。事实上你知道，首先很难遇到这个万一，其次就算真的要用，弄明白一个旧东西怎么用的功夫你已经从淘宝上下单了一个新的并且送到了门口。你不得不痛苦地给长辈解释说，为了存放那些破烂「以备万一」所占用掉的家居面积乘以单位面积房价，足够你每天买一个新的了。\n\n从这个视角往回看，你会发现我们曾经为了这些古代的神圣原则付出过多少代价。传统的办公软件（比如 powerpoint）异常臃肿笨重，因为各种你可能永远也用不着但也许对某个人某天有用的功能都必须一出厂就准备好，而今天的你完全可以为了你现在要做的 presentation 直接生成一个成品，包含任何当下的你需要的 feature，不用关心它能否被另一个 presentation 用上。传统的代码库里包含着精雕细琢的注释文档和复杂的引用依赖，因为模块会被层层复用，你需要大费周章地解释意图和注意事项，既不能过于简略别人无法理解，也不能过于冗长让人没耐心阅读。你需要隐藏复杂性，提供简洁接口，一旦软件出错，你需要非常精确的错误信息才能帮助人定位问题。——所有这些对 AI 都属于过度设计，杞人忧天。有连篇累牍解释怎么复用高阶接口的功夫，AI 已经读完了几千行底层代码和几百行报错信息，然后另起炉灶写了一个全新的模块出来。你甚至不太关心生成的东西有没有 bug，只要你用的过程中不要遇到 bug 就行，或者就算有，你再生成一个新的就是了。\n\n这当然不是说软件工程不存在了，只是成本和注意力都需要颠覆式地重新分配。底层的元件和设施也许需要更坚固更有效率——大模型基础设施供应商仍然需要千方百计从石头里榨出油来最大化每片GPU的使用，AI 本身也仍然需要调用有效的渲染引擎来支持各种定制化的高级界面——但你在链条上越靠近终端用户，就越需要提醒自己用户仅仅生活在当下，你和他们每一次长尾的、浮光掠影的、昙花一现的交互本身才是你真正要交付的产品。如果你是斯科塞斯，你关心的是你的电影是否永垂不朽。如果你想制作的是霸道总裁爱上清洁工的短剧，按照斯科塞斯的方式来执行就成了自寻死路。\n\n设想一下，如果你能够每天根据你当下的心情和需求以几乎零成本生成一套新的家具并随时无痛扔掉所有旧家具，你会怎么理解家具这个概念本身？用黄花梨木来生产日抛型家具是没有意义的。",

      "text": "这篇文章很有意思，是一个关于如何在团队或系统中提出问题、定位自我以及解决问题的精彩隐喻。\n\n作者巧妙地通过两句截然相反的谚语，探讨了职场和生活中“特立独行”的两种不同结局。\n\n以下是原文转译：\n\n《吱吱作响的钉子，抑或是突出的轮子》\n作者：Prashanth Sadasivan\n\n有两句谚语描述了类似的行为，但结局却截然相反，最终传达的寓意也天差地别：\n\n> “出头的钉子挨锤打” (注：源自日本谚语，意指枪打出头鸟，强调合群)\n\n对比\n\n> “会叫的轮子有油加” (注：源自美国谚语，意指会哭的孩子有奶吃，强调表达需求)\n\n这两句话描述的都是同一个场景：在一个更大的结构或群体中，某个个体显得格格不入，或者说有点“毛病”。但在第一种情况里，这个不合拍的个体会被强行敲打回去，直到顺从；而在另一种情况里，它的需求得到了满足，随后恢复正常运作。\n\n这两者并不完全相同，但我发现它们之间的关系非常耐人寻味。作为一个经常感觉自己无法融入群体，同时又很难开口表达需求的人，我觉得透过这两个隐喻来审视处境，能学到很多东西。\n\n钉子远没有轮子重要\n\n想象一个书架，上面的钉子数量通常比轮子多出好几个数量级。如果其中一个轮子坏了，想移动书架就会变得非常困难；但如果只是其中一颗钉子变形了，你大可以忽略它，或者轻松换掉它。\n\n当事情出现不对劲时，值得问自己一个问题：这个问题真的值得提出来吗？还是说，提出问题仅仅是为了显得自己聪明，或是为了追求某种缺乏实用价值的“技术正确”？\n\n同样重要的是，在提出问题时要清楚自己的定位和重要性——如果你是一百个零件中的一个（像钉子），那么你提出的问题，肯定不如你是十个关键零件中的一个（像轮子）时那么受重视。\n\n明确诉求且警报适度 vs. 无端拉响警报且毫无解释\n\n轮子的诉求很明确，它发出警报的方式也不会造成太大负担（吱吱作响虽然烦人，但不危险）；相比之下，凸出来的钉子更危险，而针对这一“症状”最明显的解决办法，就是把它锤回去。\n\n在提出问题时，恰当地传达紧迫感至关重要——既不能夸大，也不能低估问题的严重性。而且，当你指出问题时，应该同时提出明确的诉求，告诉大家该如何解决这个问题。\n\n有些问题在彻底崩溃前，唯一的症状就是“钉子松动”\n\n当然，我们也得为“钉子”说几句公道话！比如，为什么这颗钉子会凸出来？也许是因为书架上放了太重的东西？\n\n有些时候，确实存在需要被指出的严重问题，但除了像“锤子”那样粗暴的手段外，并没有显而易见的解决方法。这时，你不得不站出来，做那颗凸出来的“钉子”。虽然你几乎肯定会被锤回去，或者被移除/替换，但如果开始有越来越多的钉子凸出来，人们最终会开始审视整个结构的完整性出了什么问题。\n\n懂得何时指出问题，带着方案来，并在关键时刻坚定立场\n\n我喜欢把自己看作是一个能够提前发现问题，并通过提出正确问题来引发关注的人。我希望自己能更擅长分辨什么时间该要求什么，并且当我知道问题真的很严重时，能够更加坚定。\n\n我确实有点过度引申了“钉子”的比喻。这句话原本更多是关于社会从众心理，而不是关于提出问题。但在某些方面，我认为从人群中“突出来”，往往也是一种以身作则、通过亲身实践来表达你认为事情应该有所改变的方式。\n\n来源: https://t.co/qXbTb3dBe1",

It's not going to be super expensive!\nGoogle trained this from scratch on TPUs as an MoE with 1M input and 64k token output. MoE means they can afford to make this cheap.\n\n2. This is next level for Computer Use and automating real knowledge work.\nScreenSpot Pro is a very low-key benchmark which tests understanding screenshots in apps including AutoCAD, PhotoShop and many more. Gemini 3 is 2x SOTA on this with 73%.\n\n3.  Best AI for Math by far.\nGemini 3 is RLd on a ton of theorem proving data and is flawless on AIME and 23% on MathArena. Other models barely scrape 1%. There are clearly some generalized reasoning benefits given the sota 30% on ARC AGI 2 as well!\n\n4. Insanely good at coding but unclear if best.\nLive Code Bench elo of 2400+ is fantastic yet the one benchmark it doesn't get SOTA at SWE Bench. It's #1 on tool calling and terminal bench too.\n\nGoogle pulled out everything they had on this one. They perfected their training recipe, trained on all the proprietary data they had and crushed every benchmark they could. This is a meaningful step up in model quality and clear proof that AI progress isn't slowing down.\n\nI just don't know how any other company but Google wins on model quality here: they have a) cost advantage due to owning hardware b) ooms more proprietary data c) more disposal cash to spend on training and new data d) as good talent as anyone else. Flaunting their total dominance.\n\nI suspect it will be hard to beat these results in the next 6 months.",

          "text": "Sharing an interesting recent conversation on AI's impact on the economy.\n\nAI has been compared to various historical precedents: electricity, industrial revolution, etc., I think the strongest analogy is that of AI as a new computing paradigm (Software 2.0) because both are fundamentally about the automation of digital information processing.\n\nIf you were to forecast the impact of computing on the job market in ~1980s, the most predictive feature of a task/job you'd look at is to what extent the algorithm of it is fixed, i.e. are you just mechanically transforming information according to rote, easy to specify rules (e.g. typing, bookkeeping, human calculators, etc.)? Back then, this was the class of programs that the computing capability of that era allowed us to write (by hand, manually).\n\nWith AI now, we are able to write new programs that we could never hope to write by hand before. We do it by specifying objectives (e.g. classification accuracy, reward functions), and we search the program space via gradient descent to find neural networks that work well against that objective. This is my Software 2.0 blog post from a while ago. In this new programming paradigm then, the new most predictive feature to look at is verifiability. If a task/job is verifiable, then it is optimizable directly or via reinforcement learning, and a neural net can be trained to work extremely well. It's about to what extent an AI can \"practice\" something. The environment has to be resettable (you can start a new attempt), efficient (a lot attempts can be made), and rewardable (there is some automated process to reward any specific attempt that was made).\n\nThe more a task/job is verifiable, the more amenable it is to automation in the new programming paradigm. If it is not verifiable, it has to fall out from neural net magic of generalization fingers crossed, or via weaker means like imitation. This is what's driving the \"jagged\" frontier of progress in LLMs. Tasks that are verifiable progress rapidly, including possibly beyond the ability of top experts (e.g. math, code, amount of time spent watching videos, anything that looks like puzzles with correct answers), while many others lag by comparison (creative, strategic, tasks that combine real-world knowledge, state, context and common sense). \n\nSoftware 1.0 easily automates what you can specify.\nSoftware 2.0 easily automates what you can verify.",

As far as I can tell there are only ~2 reported fatalities with FSD active — both on much older versions.\n\nI'm forced to conclude that there are at least ~75 people who are alive today because of the work of the @Tesla_AI  team. And we're just getting started.\n\nTo give you a visual on that, if you put everyone in North America who is alive today because of FSD in a room together it would look like this:",
