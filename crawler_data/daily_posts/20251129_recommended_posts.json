The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels. They and their children are supported through massive payments from Patriotic American Citizens who, because of their beautiful hearts, do not want to openly complain or cause trouble in any way, shape, or form. They put up with what has happened to our Country, but it’s eating them alive to do so! A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family. The real migrant population is much higher. This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.). As an example, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota. Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for “prey” as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone. The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst “Congressman/woman” in our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when her place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military, Police, schools, etc. Even as we have progressed technologically, Immigration Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization. These goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized and illegal Autopen approval process. Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!",

They were all mentally ill messes, before and after. Including me. The MtFs I knew did not seem psychologically feminine in any way. And generally, I was often frustrated by the lack of pragmatism of progressives. I shared their stated goals, but thought they were extremely illogical about how they went about trying to achieve them. They would choose moral posturing over efficacy every time. Several times, when I pointed this out, I was told this was a “fascist mindset”. Trying to do things effectively was fascist to them. They thought moral purity was all you need.\n\nI took mushrooms on New Year’s Eve, 2022, and it all came crashing down. I sat in a dark room and the cracks in my worldview widened until it all fell apart. I realized that this attitude, this allergy to rigorous thinking and aversion to necessary trade-offs, this prioritizing of seeming virtuous over tangible results, would destroy civilization if left unchecked.\n\nBy the time I came down, I considered myself a terf despite still being trans. And I started reading everything I’d been told not to. I read J. K. Rowling’s open letter and agreed with every word. I read “The Case for Colonialism” by @BruceDGilley and works by Niall Ferguson and realized that the wealth of the West was created by our ability to innovate, not stolen. Indeed, that wealth, built from knowledge, was what enabled colonialism in the first place. I read the Bell Curve and dove into the hereditarian literature. I have enough math background that I could meaningfully understand the arguments and counterarguments, and the former seemed much stronger than the latter. More than that, it felt like hereditarians were actually trying to understand the world, while the anti-hereds were trying to obscure it. They did not feel like truth-seekers, and would frequently mix moral outrage into their technical critiques in a way that struck me as deeply suspicious and anti-scientific. \n\nOver several months of intense study, I reversed my position on most major policy issues. But the deeper change was philosophical, even spiritual. I fully accepted the necessary imperfection of the world, that progress is only possible via sacrifice, that we can only advance as a society if we can tolerate some people losing, that trying to eliminate all pain and loss would end up causing far more. Inequality is not inherently bad, and indeed is a necessary condition for the growth of knowledge at every scale of existence, from biology to economics. Evolution, whether biological or memetic or economic, is the only mechanism in existence that can produce order from chaos, structure from noise, beauty from nothingness. And evolution requires that weaker organisms, weaker ideas, weaker companies, and weaker nations be allowed to fail. Trying to prevent this stops the great engine of creation and leads to decay. \n\n“To the precise extent that we are spared, even for a moment, we degenerate”\n\nThis strikes most as cold and cruel. But it is the nature of reality, and it is not clear it could be otherwise even in principle. If my aesthetics were not aligned with it, then my aesthetics, rather than the structure of existence, were what was wrong. I learned to see the beauty in creative destruction. I glimpsed a vision of God. And it changed my life. I detransitioned, started posting, got a job (via X), fell in love (via X). Now some of the most important people in the world read the words I write. I feel a deep and abiding sense of gratitude. And, after years of severe depression, I am excited to be alive.",

The chaos and lawlessness would have spread to unimaginable levels. \n\nAlready in Blue cities, Democrat policies of zero bail, under-prosecution of felonies, and a revolving door at the jails have given repeat criminals license to prey on an innocent population. Depraved murderous attacks by repeat offenders, such as the horrors inflicted on poor Iryna Zarutska or Bethany MaGee or Logan Federico, are already too commonplace.\n\nOnly the election of President Donald Trump has given the country another chance. I give thanks for the miracle that saved his life from an assassin’s bullet. I am grateful for his courage, determination, and indefatigability in making America great again.\n\nI am grateful for the extraordinary team that surrounds the President, starting with the Vice President JD Vance and the White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. I appreciate all my colleagues at the White House, and consider it an honor to be a small part of this administration. \n\nIn politics, it’s easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees. Thanksgiving is a day to look up, take stock, and count our blessings. \n\nWe still have much to do but also much to be grateful for. Thank you to President Trump for working tirelessly on behalf of the American people. \n\nHave a great Thanksgiving. God bless you, your families and the United States of America. 🇺🇸",

        "text": "dontbesilent 的 100 条思考\n\n001.\n语言的边界就是思维的边界，使用垃圾语言就会拥有垃圾思维。\n\n002.\n赚钱只需要执行力 + 商业模式，很多赚到钱的人都没有认知，甚至智力都不正常。\n\n003.\n找对标的本质是降维模仿：当你想达成某个目标时，应该去模仿那些已经超额完成该目标的对象。\n\n004.\n如果你愿意去模仿任何对标，那么所有业务都可以是你的对标；如果你只愿意去模仿和你一模一样的对标，那么世界上将没有业务可以成为你的对标。\n\n005.\n做自媒体的门槛是要意识到：你可以通过文字来控制其他人。\n\n006.\n顾客需求是购买商品，不是使用商品。商家只关注你买不买，不关注你用不用。\n\n007.\n好的商业模式会逼你成为一个好人，坏的商业模式会逼你成为一个恶人。\n\n008.\n真正有价值的知识，越分享越值钱。\n\n009.\n不问前路，先发 100 条。这里面，前半句其实比后半句重要。\n\n010.\n绝大多数忙于赚钱却赚不到钱的人，并非不知道正确答案，而是在明知正解的情况下，竭尽全力寻找绕过它的方法。\n\n011.\n只要你拥有常识，就可以在任何一个行业里打败 90% 的竞争对手。\n\n012.\n商业是最大的慈善，因为互不相欠。免费的帮助，常常滋生仇恨。\n\n013.\n人与人之间最完美的距离叫做商品。\n\n014.\n这世上所有的商品都只是给买家一个转账的理由而已。\n\n015.\n如果一个人用 AI 写的文字发出来之后被平台限流了，原因不在于 AI 模型能力不行，而在于用 AI 的这个人对于文字没有洁癖。\n\n016.\n所有让你在自媒体上讲「干货」的博主，都是不专业、不入流的。\n\n017.\n内容需要是差异化的、不能太 low、产品需要是高质量的——这和赚钱有啥关系？这都是商家的心理需求，用户需求是一点不提。\n\n018.\n越是新手，越应该推高成本做内容，否则就会进入「内容差 - 没流量 - 希望以量取胜 - 内容更差」的死亡螺旋。\n\n019.\n投入精力 ≠ 内容好。投入精力 × 对内容有正确理解 = 内容好。\n\n020.\n我们的目标是摆脱小白的身份，成为领域里的专家。这是第一目标。这是信仰与追求。\n\n021.\n万能问题是错误问题，万能答案是错误答案。一个无法精准描述问题的人，是不可能得到答案的。\n\n022.\n提问的过程就是思考的过程，如果你能提出一个好问题，这个事情就已经解决了 80%。\n\n023.\n解决问题的前提是定义问题，这里的「问题」指的是 question，而不是 problem。\n\n024.\n赚钱七字诀是：不问前路直接干。找我的人基本都是：暂时不干我先问问。神仙难助。\n\n025.\n抄生意，分为全抄和半抄。全抄拼执行，半抄拼认知。\n\n026.\n做什么事情都是二八定律。比如直播做到第一，20% 靠我的直播能力，80% 靠我播到凌晨 2：00，把其他人都熬下播。\n\n027.\n如果你不能在每天工作 2 小时的情况下维持收入，很可能是你没有找到最正确的那件事情是什么。\n\n028.\n从不认为自己是任何一个行业的从业者。我随时可以去任何行业做任何事。\n\n029.\n「想赚钱」的意思就是不想赚钱，「正在赚钱」的意思才是想赚钱。\n\n030.\n赚钱分两步：1、找到答案；2、执行。如果你现在没有执行，说明你没有找到答案。\n\n031.\n这个世界上离钱最远的地方，叫做：想找一个自己擅长的事情去赚钱。\n\n032.\n沉迷于战术，使人既疲惫，又贫穷。\n\n033.\n把「赛道」「行业」这俩词从脑子里删掉，赚钱就会容易一些。\n\n034.\n智商决定收入上限，商业模式决定收入下限。\n\n035.\n智力低也是可以赚到钱的。缺乏认知和智力，影响赚大钱，但不影响赚到钱。\n\n036.\n做内容之前，要确保你有产品。如果你不能把你的付款链接发给我，并且让我通过微信或者支付宝付款成功，你就是没有产品。\n\n037.\n定价即产品，产品即定价。\n\n038.\n如何判断一个赛道是否拥挤？你就看同行的定价就知道个差不多。\n\n039.\n毛利应该重新定义为「售价 - 营销成本」。在流量为王的时代，营销成本才是真正的「生产成本」。\n\n040.\n「卖产品赚钱」不是一件事，是 N 件事。第一层是有人需要这个产品，第二层是有人愿意为这个产品付钱，第三层是有很多人愿意付钱，第四层是我可以持续性地获取流量。\n\n041.\n小红书 = 内容平台；抖音 = 内容电商平台。\n\n042.\n中国真正的播客，不是 podcast，是抖音。\n\n043.\n国内的小老板不愿意给美国人 19 美金，最终的结果就是给中国人割 198000 人民币。\n\n044.\n知识付费的核心不是缓解焦虑，但是缓解焦虑是知识付费的必要组成部分。\n\n045.\n好的「IP 知识付费」应该是围绕「IP」和「付费」做内容，而不是围绕「知识」做内容。\n\n046.\n小红书上 1w 粉丝月入 10w 是可以的。前提有二：1. IP 人设差异化内容；2. 内容与产品强匹配，自己卖货，不接广告。\n\n047.\n有价值的行动，进行积分之后，会变成有价值的商品。\n\n048.\n对关键词的理解永无止境。当我们说喝「拿铁」和说喝「咖啡」的时候，我们在说两件事情。\n\n049.\n组织内部应该禁用没有定义过的主观词汇。\n\n050.\n我们用语言思考，所以语言的边界就成了思维的边界。每个词背后都隐藏着特定的世界观和假设。\n\n051.\n维特根斯坦说：不存在只有我自己能理解的语言，语言必须是公共的、可验证的。\n\n052.\n哲学书里面，有你需要的所有提示词。哲学家们用了 2000 多年时间研究：如何清晰思考、如何准确表达、如何有效论证。\n\n053.\n要精通 DeepSeek，先把康德、休谟、维特根斯坦读完。不谈哲学就没有入 DeepSeek 的门。\n\n054.\n第一桶金常常会面临生意方向的抉择。路线 1：产品需求强，但是做起来阻力大；路线 2：产品需求弱，没竞争。这个时候一定要坚定选择路线 1。1 的问题是可以努力解决的，2 的问题是神也解决不了的。\n\n055.\n我喜欢做的生意，是和同行在供应链完全没有任何差异的那种。你休想和我在产品上有任何差异化，无处躲藏。\n\n056.\n会对标和不会对标的人的区别就是，前者打心底相信「和对标保持一致」这句话是真理。\n\n057.\n模仿到极致，就是创新的开始；问题被看透，就是答案的终结。\n\n058.\n如果你看到对方抖音直播间的女主播的袜子上面出现了 3 个线头，而你们女主播的袜子上只有 2 个线头，你就没有模仿对标。\n\n059.\n对标是用来模仿的。如果你愿意模仿任何对象，全世界的生意都可以成为你的对标。\n\n060.\n找对标能解决的是业务逻辑问题，但前提是执行者已经解决了「人的问题」。\n\n061.\n真正的学习不是看书上课，而是完整走完同行的每一个流程，直到你能预测对方的所有行为。\n\n062.\n目标要降维，心态要升维。想月入 10 万，就去模仿月入百万的生意。\n\n063.\n量化练习产生质变。看懂 100 条爆款视频能破万粉，看懂 1000 条能破十万粉。\n\n064.\n学文案、学抖音有个很快的方法，就是你去找一堆爆款视频，不看开头，就从 15s 开始看，然后你想一下这个开头如果是你，你会怎么写。\n\n065.\n一个人对正确方法了解得越清楚，他逃避的动力就越强。因为清晰的认知意味着无可推诿的责任。\n\n066.\n在信息透明的时代，持续贫穷往往是一种主动选择——选择舒适的自我欺骗，而非艰难的自我实现。\n\n067.\n最大的悲剧不是不知道答案，而是明知答案却选择逃避——因为自由太沉重，牢笼更轻松。\n\n068.\n当你提出了一个问题，是说明你没有看懂这件事情。如果我能让你看懂这件事情，你将没有问题。\n\n069.\n我做了个答疑社群给几千人答过疑，我并不是在提供答案，我是在消解问题。\n\n070.\n我的终极目标并不是要提供所有问题的答案，而是看清楚所有的事情，以至于没有问题可问。\n\n071.\n国内知识付费市场的主流本质是「认知套利」：卖方利用买方的无知获利，而买方用金钱购买心理安慰。\n\n072.\n在国内知识付费市场的主流业态中，业务转化率与受众智力水平呈反比关系。\n\n073.\n国内这些搞什么 IP 定位智能体的人没有意识到，他们是用 AI 做了一个诈骗业务。干掉你们的不是 claude，是警察。\n\n074.\n如果一个人抱怨 AI 生成的文案「有 AI 味」时，这种判断往往揭示了一个有趣的现象：评判者将本该由自己承担的审美责任，不自觉地转移给了工具本身。\n\n075.\n让 AI 分析爆款文案，是最蠢的方法。爆款文案长啥样，不重要；爆款文案是如何被塑造的，很重要。规则 > 结果。\n\n076.\n为什么 AI 经常会写「请你记住」「真相是 xxx」？因为无能的创作者会频繁使用祈使句制造紧迫感，尝试用语气的强度去代替逻辑的强度。\n\n077.\n所有「去 AI 味」的提示词，都是不懂文字的人写出来的。因为去 AI 味是伪命题。\n\n078.\nAI 写的东西有没有价值？如果是好内容的话，没人关心这东西是怎么出来的。\n\n079.\n关心自己的文案有没有 AI 味的人很多，关心自己的文案好不好的人很少。然而，英雄是不问出处的。\n\n080.\n如果你教的东西别人很容易学会，那无论保留还是公开都赚不到钱。如果你教的东西有真正的难度，即使毫无保留地公开，别人在实践中仍会遇到问题。\n\n081.\n真正的问题不在于你有 1 层储备你要怎么分配，而是你要花多久才能搞到 10 层储备。不要从顾客身上找答案，从自己身上找答案。\n\n082.\n如果你有 10 层储备，引流款讲 3 层，利润款讲 3 层，还剩 4 层，不是我不想讲，而是没人对我这套晦涩难懂、不能快速变现的商业本体论感兴趣。\n\n083.\n有执行力、有探索精神的人是在认同，知识是在实践的过程当中产生的。没有执行力的人，是相信可以在实践之前就拥有知识。\n\n084.\n人们自以为的需求和人们实际上想要的，是两套算法，前者是因果，后者是相关。\n\n085.\n授人以鱼，可盆满钵满；授人以渔，如杀人放火。\n\n086.\n做自媒体不要抱怨被骂。如果你骗人了，被骂是理所应当；如果你没骗人，就会被另外 99% 想被骗的人骂。\n\n087.\n当你的认知高于观众一个段位，他们会关注你；高十个段位，他们就开始辱骂你；高一百个段位，他们会嘲笑你。\n\n088.\n没销售能力的人，都爱拿「精准人群」当遮羞布。\n\n089.\n好的内容产出场所，应该是没有压力的。就是这种自由，能孵化好内容。\n\n090.\n思维都是涌现出来的，如有雷同，纯属巧合，谈不上竞争与否。\n\n091.\n我对绝大多数所谓 AI 社群的评价：如果一条信息，在我需要的时候我唾手可得，而你在不确定我是否需要的时候发给了我，这就是垃圾信息。\n\n092.\n绝大多数知识博主都在基于有限的、二手的、索然无味的信息差去变现，压根不研究业务，毫无科研精神。\n\n093.\n跨过执行力的心理门槛之后，会发现首先得到的不是钱，而是社会支持。\n\n094.\n绝大多数的「割」都来源于一个点，就是当事人觉得他没能用 AI 写好文案，是他不懂 AI，是他没选对 AI 产品。没意识到这个事情是在于他不懂文案，没理解文字本身。\n\n095.\n如果一个岗位被定义为特定角色的智能体，就一定会失业。如果一个岗位被定义为给人类或者 AI 制定工作流，就不会失业。\n\n096.\n如果你不知道怎么把一个前端交互页面变成钱，就会觉得：Gemini 3 来了，前端已死。如果你知道怎么把一个前端交互页面变成钱，就会觉得：受限于前端成本而被压制的供给，现在可以直接起飞。\n\n097.\n知识博主的核心工作只有两个：1、把事情搞清楚；2、把事情说清楚。「把事情搞清楚」是一切的开端。\n\n098.\n不要试图正当化不道德的行为，不要试图用数字来计算道德，承认世界的悲剧性，而不是试图通过破坏规则来逃避悲剧。因为一旦规则被破坏，长期来看，所有人都会更糟。\n\n099.\nAI 割韭菜项目都是同一个逻辑：买家希望有个神仙级的武器让自己不劳而获，卖家想骗买家，现在加上一个话术叫做「人工智能太 nb 了」。\n\n100.\n从「想赚钱」到「正在赚钱」，中间隔着的不是方法，而是你愿不愿意承认：那些你明知道正确却不愿意做的事情，才是你贫穷的真正原因。",

Environmental groups have been screaming about grid load and gas generators for months.\n\nNow they're getting 550 acres of renewable energy.\n\nEnvironmental activists claimed xAI would \"strain the grid\" and \"rely on fossil fuels.\" \n\nElon's response? Deploy more solar capacity than most cities see in a decade.\n\nThe local state rep who complained loudest said xAI \"does not care about the people who live here.\" Those people are about to have the most advanced solar infrastructure in Tennessee.\n\nThis is the pattern critics refuse to acknowledge: Elon gets attacked for scaling too fast, then over-delivers on the exact solution they demanded, making them look ridiculous.\n\nTesla faced the same playbook. \n\"EVs aren't practical!\" Build Supercharger network. \"Battery production isn't clean!\" Build battery recycling. \"Grid can't handle it!\" Powerwall solves it.\n\nxAI's doing it again. The AI arms race requires massive compute. \n\nColossus needs power. Instead of fighting Memphis or moving facilities, Elon's funding enough solar to make the entire operation carbon-neutral while powering local infrastructure.\n\nGrok trained on this supercomputer. \nNow it runs on Tennessee sunshine.\n\nSource: David Royer, Local Memphis News",

      "text": "转译：Claude Opus 4.5 的提示词（Prompting）实战指南\n\n为了帮助大家更好地驾驭新模型，我们的研究与应用团队经过大量内部测试和“折腾”，总结了一份针对 Claude Opus 4.5 的提示词（Prompting）实战指南。\n\n以下是我们目前摸索出的“独家秘籍”，教你如何榨干它的潜能，获得最佳效果：\n\n1. 用好 effort 参数，想多聪明你说了算\n\n新的 effort（努力值）参数简直是个神器。它能让你大体控制 Claude 在输出内容时消耗多少算力。这就好比你有了一个调节旋钮：你可以通过它，在“智能程度”与“成本/响应速度”之间做一个权衡 （向左转省钱快出结果，向右转费点时间但智商爆表）。\n\n这个参数对所有类型的 Token （AI 处理文本的最小单位，相当于单词或汉字） 都有效，包括模型的思考过程、正式回复以及工具调用。\n\n2. 别太凶，温柔点：调整工具触发率\n\n你可能会发现工具触发的频率变了。这是因为 Opus 4.5 对系统提示词（System Prompts）的反应更加灵敏。\n\n以前为了防止它“偷懒”不调用工具 （Undertriggering，即触发不足），你的旧提示词可能使用过非常激进或严厉的语言。但在新版本里，这样反而会导致它变得太敏感，动不动就乱用工具 （Overtriggering，即触发过度）。\n\n所以，是时候把语气放缓了。将原来那种 “CRITICAL: You MUST use this tool”（严重警告：你必须使用此工具）的命令，改成平和的 “Use this tool when...”（当出现……情况时，使用此工具）就可以了。\n\n3. 防止“加戏”：避免过度设计\n\nOpus 4.5 有时候会有点“想太多”，导致过度设计 （Overengineer，即把简单问题复杂化），比如凭空增加不必要的文件或者搞一堆复杂的抽象层。\n\n要解决这个问题，你得在提示词里把话说明白，比如加上：“Only make changes that are directly requested. Keep solutions simple and focused.”（只修改我明确要求的部分。保持解决方案简洁、聚焦。）\n\n4. 拒绝“云写代码”：强制它先读后写\n\n在探索代码库时，Opus 4.5 有时会表现得比较保守。\n\n如果你发现它没看代码就直接瞎提修改建议，请直接给它下死命令：“ALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected.”（在提出修改建议前，必须总是先阅读并理解相关文件。绝对不要对自己没检查过的代码进行猜测。）\n\n5. 眼神更好了：视觉能力大升级\n\nOpus 4.5 的视觉能力有了显著提升，处理图像和提取数据的能力更强了，尤其是在同时处理多张图片的时候。\n\n对于那些信息量巨大、密密麻麻的图片 （Dense Images），教你个绝招：给它配备一个裁剪工具，让它能像用放大镜一样“放大”并聚焦于局部细节。在我们的测试评估中，这一招能稳定提升它的表现。\n\n如果你想快速应用上述所有技巧，将你的应用无缝迁移到 Opus 4.5，可以直接使用我们制作的这个 Claude Code 迁移插件：\n\nhttps://t.co/VcKqNIWp2A\n\n就连我们自己，每天也都还在挖掘这个新模型的潜力！如果你有什么独门秘籍，欢迎在下方分享。",

      "text": "想象一下，一个软件团队在做一个大项目，但有个奇怪的规定：每个工程师只能工作几十分钟，最多几小时，干完就要换一个新的工程师。所以让这个团队完成简单项目任务还行，复杂一点需要长时间运行的项目，比如你让它克隆一个 claude .ai，它就做不到。\n\n这其实就是 Coding Agent 的现状：没有记忆，上下文窗口长度有限。所以要它执行长时间任务，它还做不好。\n\nAnthropic 的这篇博客：《Effective harnesses for long-running agents》，专门讨论了如何让 Agent 在跨越多个上下文窗口时依然能持续推进任务。\n\n先看 Agent 在长任务中遇到的主要问题是什么？\n\n主要三种：\n\n第一种叫一口气干太多。比如你让 Agent 克隆一个 claude .ai 这样的网站，它会试图一次性搞定整个应用。结果上下文还没用完，功能写了一半，代码乱成一锅粥。下一个会话进来，面对半成品只能干瞪眼，花很多时间猜测前面到底做了什么。\n\n第二种叫过早宣布胜利。项目做了一部分，后来的 Agent 看看环境，觉得好像差不多了，就直接收工。功能缺一大堆也不管。\n\n第三种叫测试敷衍。Agent 改完代码，跑几个单元测试或者 curl 一下接口就觉得万事大吉，根本没有像真实用户那样端到端走一遍流程。\n\n这三种失败模式的共同点是 Agent 不知道全局目标，也不知道该在哪里停下来、该留下什么给下一位。\n\n那么 Anthropic 的解决方案是什么呢？\n\n其实就是软件工程的一些现成的解决方案：引入类似人类团队的分工协作机制，将复杂任务拆解成小的可跟踪验证的任务，清晰的交接机制，并严格验证任务结果\n\n一个初始化 Agent，它只在项目启动时出场一次，任务是搭好项目运行环境：有点像架构师的角色，写一个 init .sh 脚本方便后续启动开发服务器，建一个 claude-progress.txt 记录进度，做第一次 git 提交，最关键的是生成一份功能清单。\n\n这份功能清单有多细？在克隆 claude .ai 的案例中，列了超过 200 条具体功能，比如用户能打开新对话、输入问题、按回车、看到 AI 回复。每一条初始状态都标记为失败，后续 Agent 必须逐条验证通过才能改成成功。\n\n而且这里有个细节，这个清单不是用 Markdown 来写的，是一个 JSON 数组，因为 Anthropic 实验发现，相比 Markdown，模型在处理 JSON 时更不容易随意篡改或覆盖文件。\n\n另一个是编码 Agent。在初始化项目后，后续就是它干活了，核心行为准则只有两条：一次只做一个功能，做完要留下干净的环境。\n\n什么叫干净的环境？想象你往主分支提交代码的标准：没有严重 bug，代码整齐有文档，下一个人接手能直接开始新功能，不用先替你收拾烂摊子。\n\n每次开工前，它先做几件事：\n\n– 运行 pwd 看看自己在哪个目录\n– 读 Git 日志和进度文件，搞清楚上一轮干了啥\n– 看功能清单，挑一个最高优先级的未完成功能\n– 跑一遍基础测试，确保 App 还能用\n\n然后专心做一个功能，做完后：\n\n– 写清楚的 Git commit message\n– 更新 claude-progress.txt\n– 只改功能清单里的状态字段，绝不删改需求本身\n\n这个设计的巧妙之处在于，它把“记忆”外化成了文件和 Git 历史。每一轮的 Agent 不需要依赖上下文窗口里的碎片信息，而是模仿靠谱的人类工程师每天上班会做的事。先同步进度，确认环境正常，再动手干活。\n\n测试环节的改进值得单独说。\n\n原来 Agent 只会用代码层面的方式验证，比如跑单元测试或者调接口。问题是很多 bug 只有用户真正操作页面时才会暴露。\n\n解决方案是给 Agent 配上浏览器自动化工具，比如 Puppeteer MCP。Agent 现在能像真人一样打开浏览器、点按钮、填表单、看页面渲染结果。Anthropic 放了一张动图，展示 Agent 测试克隆版 claude .ai 时自己截的图，确实是在像用户那样操作。\n\n这招大幅提升了功能验证的准确率。当然也有边界，比如浏览器原生的 alert 弹窗，Puppeteer 捕捉不到，依赖弹窗的功能就容易出 bug。\n\n这套方案还留了一些开放问题。\n\n比如，到底是一个通用 Agent 全包好，还是搞专业分工？让测试 Agent 专门测，代码清理 Agent 专门收拾，也许效果更好。\n\n再比如，这套经验是针对全栈 Web 开发优化的，能不能迁移到科研或金融建模这类长周期任务？应该可以，但需要实验验证。\n\n响马 @xicilion 说：\n> ai 的尽头依旧是软件工程。\n\nAI Agent 也不是魔法，它一样需要从人类软件工程中汲取经验，它也需要将复杂的任务进行分解成简单的任务，要有一个结构化的工作环境和清晰的交接机制。\n\n人类工程师为什么能跨团队、跨时区协作？因为有 Git、有文档、有 Code Review、有测试。AI Agent 要想长时间自主工作，也得把这些东西搬过来。\n\nAnthropic 的方案，不过是把软件工程的最佳实践变成了 Agent 能理解的提示词和工具链。不是让模型变得更聪明，而是给它提供更好的脚手架。\n\nAnthropic 的思路值得借鉴。无论你用的是 Claude、GPT 还是别的模型，在设计多轮长任务时，都要想清楚，怎么让下一轮的 Agent 快速进入状态，怎么避免它重复造轮子或者把代码搞成一团乱麻。即使是单轮任务，也要清楚它是没有记忆的，你需要通过外部文件来帮助它“想起来”之前做过的事。\n\n以现在模型的能力，Coding Agent 已经能做很多事情了，核心还是在于你是不是能像软件工程中那样，去分解好任务，设计好工作的流程。\n\n原文：Effective harnesses for long-running agents https://t.co/tERUGrV9wC\n翻译：https://t.co/MByV8iiEoZ",

A woman reclining in an antique porcelain bathtub, glowing realistic texture with wet skin effect, wet euphoria look makeup with thin eyeliner and golden eyeshadows, dewy/glowing finish. Wearing lightweight translucent fabric partially submerged in water, clinging to skin, with visible distorted tattoos slightly underwater. Accessories include a thin necklace and discreet ring. Set in an antique bathroom with white tiles with subtle cracks, translucent water covered in dark petals of deep wine, purple, and black colors. Lighting with soft golden light, reflections on water surface, subsurface scattering on skin, atmospheric warmth, intimate, serene, euphoric mood.",

Leftist extremist terrorism is now part of everyday life. It's killing our children at school, our generational political leaders on campus, shooting our presidential candidates in the head in broad daylight and viciously attacking our US Military, federal law enforcement and police.\n\nThis is an all-out war on law, order, and the safety of everyday Americans. The hysterical violent rhetoric spewed by the left and the media is being acted upon by Democrats across the country. It's only escalating.\n\nWhen will enough be enough? \nIn just the past year:\n\n- The seditious six Democrats claiming President Trump telling the military to not follow orders\n- Jay Jones openly fantasizing about murdering Republicans and their children wins election in Virginia\n- President Trump experiencing two assassination attempts\n- Charlie Kirk assassinated on live TV, the left celebrated\n- Attacks on ICE officers have skyrocketed over 1000%\n- LA Riots and terror attacks\n- Leftist sniper murders three at ICE facility in Texas \n- Massive violent riots at ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois and Portland Oregon\n- Annunciation Catholic Church children shot while praying by left wing Trump-hating transgender activist\n- ABC News stations shot up\n- Alina Habba attacked\n- Ed Martin Attacked\n- Rogue judges releasing career criminals back onto the streets, terrorizing Americans\n\nNow an ambush attack on the National Guard protecting DC.\n\nIf we do not recognize the scale of this threat and take it seriously, we will lose everything. The time to destroy the leftist terrorism industry and ideology is now.",

Not mathematically.\n\nIt’s concentrated - absurdly concentrated - in fractions of fractions of the population.\n\nThis isn’t ideology.\nIt’s decades of DOJ, PD, and academic data all pointing at the same tiny cluster:\n\n• ~0.5% of residents linked to 50–70% of shootings\n• Most homicide suspects have 8–12+ prior arrests\n• Victims usually know their attackers\n• Violence clusters block-to-block, not citywide\n\nIt blows apart the comforting narrative that crime is this vague atmospheric force that “just happens.”\n\nIt strips out the comforting “society failed them” story and forces a harsher question:\n\nIf 1% is driving the carnage, why is the entire system designed around treating it like a 100% problem?\n\nWhy?\nBecause it’s easier to redesign a city than to confront the handful of people actually pulling triggers.\n\nIt’s easier to blame “society” in general than acknowledge that a tiny network of repeat offenders is blowing holes in entire neighborhoods.\n\nCrime is driven by a hyper-small group of chronic, high-risk individuals interacting with each other in micro-geographies the rest of the city rarely sees.\n\nAt some point, every major city will be forced to admit the truth:\nYou don’t need to fix everyone.\n\nYou need to fix (or isolate) the 1% doing the damage.\n\nSource: DOJ, NIJ, Harvard, UCSB, Rutgers\nMedia: The New Yorker",

More than 100 American operators arrived by MH-60 helicopters with MQ-9 Reapers overhead, striking cave positions held by about 10 to 15 ISIS fighters in the Bakuuje and Mareero areas of the Cal Miskaad range. PCTF pushed in with roughly 200 troops after several days of U.S. airstrikes that had already killed multiple militants.\n\nThe raid triggered two to four hours of close-quarters clashes inside fortified caves, including engagements with foreign fighters from Syria, Turkey, and Ethiopia. By sunrise, U.S. and PCTF forces had withdrawn with no reported American casualties.\n\nEarly results indicate a senior ISIS-Somalia commander and several aides were killed, along with a total of 5 to 10 terrorists. Forces also destroyed weapons caches and equipment used for gold-mining operations that funded the group. \n\nPuntland’s leadership says its Operation Hilaac now controls almost all of the Cal Miskaad mountains and aims to eliminate ISIS-Somalia by December 2025.\n\nImages: Somalia ISIS leader Abdulkadir Mumin and his terrorists",

      "text": "Ilya：扩展时代已经结束了，研究的时代已经开始\n\nIlya Sutskever 大概得有一年多没参加播客访谈了，自从 OpenAI 宫斗离职创办 SSI（Safe Superintelligence）后之后就很少露面了，\n\n最近，他在 Dwarkesh Patel 的播客中进行了一场长达一个半小时的深度对谈。Ilya 毕竟是 Ilya，他不像 Sam Altman 整天满嘴跑火车，只是为了卖货，访谈里面有很多干货，我猜一些观点甚至会影响以后 AI 在研发和投资上的走向。\n\n一个多小时的内容很难说几句话就总结完，还是按照话题挨个整理一下。\n\n【1】为什么 AI 能在考试中碾压人类，却修不好一个简单的 bug？\n\nIlya 在访谈里抛出一个很多人都遇到过也困惑过的现象：现在的模型在各种评分上表现惊艳，但用起来却远远跟不上能力曲线。更诡异的是，你让它改个 bug，它改完引入新 bug；你指出新 bug，它道歉后又改回旧 bug。两个 bug 来回切换，像在打乒乓球。\n\nIlya 使用一个类比来解释这个问题的：想象两个学生。\n\n第一个立志成为顶级竞赛程序员，刷了一万小时题，背熟所有算法模板，练到条件反射般精准。第二个觉得竞赛挺酷，随便练了一百小时，也拿了不错的成绩。\n\n哪个人未来职业发展更好？\n\n大概率是第二个。\n\nIlya 说，现在的模型比第一个学生还极端。训练时把所有竞赛题都刷了，还做了数据增强生成更多变体，一遍遍强化。结果就是：所有算法技巧都刻在指尖，但这种准备程度本身就限制了泛化能力。\n\n这个类比点破了一件事：能力和泛化是两回事。刷题刷到极致，可能恰恰堵死了触类旁通的路。\n\n【2】真正的 reward hacking（奖励作弊）是人类研究员\n\n问题出在哪？Ilya 认为是训练数据的选择逻辑变了。\n\n预训练时代很简单：数据越多越好，什么都往里塞，不用挑。但 RL（强化学习）时代不一样了。你得选择做什么强化训练、用什么环境、优化什么目标。\n\n于是一个微妙的循环出现了：研究员想让发布时的 benchmark 得分数字好看，就设计能提升这些指标的 RL 训练。模型变得越来越会考试，但考试能力和真实世界能力之间的鸿沟被放大了。\n\n讽刺的是，真正在奖励作弊的不是模型，是设计训练的人在不知不觉中过度关注了考试成绩。\n\n【3】为什么人类学东西这么快\n\n说到这里就要问一个更深的问题：为什么人类学东西这么快，而且这么稳？\n\nIlya 提到一个特别有意思的医学案例：有个人因为脑损伤，失去了所有情绪——不会难过、不会愤怒、不会兴奋。看起来他还是能说话，能做智力题，测试分数也正常。但他的生活彻底崩溃了：花几个小时决定穿哪双袜子，财务决策一塌糊涂。\n\n这说明什么？情绪不只是情绪，它在某种程度上充当了内置的价值函数。它告诉你什么事值得做，什么选择是好是坏，不需要等到最后结果出来才知道。\n\n价值函数是个技术术语，但概念不难理解。传统的强化学习是这样的：模型做一长串动作，最后得到一个分数，然后用这个分数去调整之前所有步骤。问题是，如果任务需要做很久才有结果，学习效率就很低。\n\n价值函数的作用是“提前剧透”。比如下棋时你丢了一个子，不用下完整局就知道这步不好。编程时如果探索了一个方向走了一千步发现不对，价值函数能让你在一开始选择这个方向时就得到负反馈。\n\n这就像 GPS 导航，不是等你开到终点才告诉你这条路不对，而是在你刚拐错弯时就开始重新规划。\n\n人类大概就是有这么一套系统。而且这套系统的妙处在于：它相对简单，却在非常广泛的情况下都管用。我们的情绪主要是从哺乳动物祖先那里继承来的，针对的是几百万年前的环境，但放到现代社会居然还能用得不错。当然也有失灵的时候，比如面对满街的美食，我们的饥饿感就管不住了。\n\n【4】堆算力堆数据的扩展时代已经结束了，研究的时代已经开始\n\nIlya 认为规模化时代结束了？\n\n他给了个很有意思的视角：在 2012 到 2020 年，大家在做研究，试这试那，看什么有意思。然后 2020 年左右，scaling law(规模化定律) 被发现了，GPT-3 横空出世。突然之间所有人意识到：原来只要扩展规模，堆数据、堆算力、堆模型参数大小，一路扩充，就能稳定得到更好的结果。\n\n规模化的好处是低风险。而研究是有风险的，你得雇一堆聪明人去探索，不保证有成果。但规模化？只要投入更多资源，就一定能看到回报。公司喜欢这种确定性。但副作用是它吸走了房间里所有的氧气，创新空间被压缩，最后变成“公司比想法多”的局面。\n\n但现在呢？预训练的数据就那么多，互联网就这么大，总会用完。Gemini 据说找到了从预训练榨取更多的方法，但这条路终归有尽头。然后大家转向了强化学习，开始在那上面堆算力。\n\n可问题是：现在算力已经这么大了，再 100 倍真的会质变吗？Ilya 不这么认为。他觉得我们又回到了需要思考到底该做什么的阶段，而不是继续闷头堆资源。\n\n这就像爬山。一开始你发现有条路，往上走就是了，越走越高。但总有一天，你会发现这条路到头了，再往前走也高不了多少。这时候要么换条路，要么换种爬法，总之不能继续原来的策略。\n\n现在的 AI 行业就处在这个节点上。所以 Ilya 说：我们回到了研究时代，只不过这次手里有大得多的计算机。\n\n【5】泛化能力才是核心问题\n\n在 Ilya 看来，当前最根本的问题是：这些模型泛化能力太差了。\n\n什么叫泛化能力差？就是学一样东西需要的数据量太多，而且学会的东西换个场景就不灵了。\n\n人类不是这样的。一个青少年学开车，10 个小时基本就能上路了。而且人类五岁小孩的视觉能力就足以支持自动驾驶了，虽然他不会开车，但识别路况、判断距离这些能力已经很强了，而且这些能力是在父母家里那种数据多样性很低的环境里学会的。\n\n更关键的是，人类学编程、学数学这些东西也很快。这些可不是进化给我们的能力，因为我们的祖先根本不需要写代码。这说明人类不光是在某些特定任务上有进化优势，而是在学习这件事本身上就有某种更本质的能力。\n\n模型呢？虽然在某些具体任务上超过了普通人，但要说学习能力，还差得远。\n\nIlya 对这个问题有想法，但他说现在不能详细聊，因为在这个竞争激烈的领域，不是所有机器学习想法都能公开讨论的。不过他给了个方向性的提示：这很可能跟如何做到像人类那样高效、稳定的泛化有关。\n\n还有一个可能的阻碍：也许人类的神经元实际上比我们想的做更多计算？如果是这样，事情就更复杂了。但不管怎样，人类的存在本身就证明了这种高效学习是可能的。\n\n【6】重新定义 AGI：从成品到学习者\n\n这里 Ilya 做了一个概念上的重要修正。\n\nAGI 这个概念怎么来的？是作为“狭隘 AI”的反面而诞生的。以前的 AI 只会下棋，只会玩游戏，非常狭隘。所以大家说：我们要造通用的 AI，什么都能做的 AI。\n\n预训练强化了这个印象，因为预训练确实让模型在各种任务上都变强。于是“通用 AI”和“预训练”在概念上绑定了。\n\n但这里有个问题：按照这个定义，人类自己都不算 AGI。\n\n人类有一套基础能力，但缺乏大量具体知识。我们靠的是持续学习。一个聪明的十五岁孩子什么都不会，但学什么都快。“去当程序员”、“去当医生”、“去学习”，部署本身就包含一个学习和试错的过程。\n\n所以 Ilya 心目中的超级智能，不是一个出厂就什么都会的成品，而是一个能像人一样快速学习任何技能的学习者。\n\n【7】能自动学习的 AI 会有多快到来？有多危险？\n\n那么问题来了：如果有这样一个系统，能像人类一样快速学习，而且可以大量复制部署，会发生什么？\n\n人类入职六个月才能产出价值，但这种 AI 可能几周就行。而且不同副本学到的东西还能合并，这是人类做不到的。这难道不会导致某种爆炸式增长？\n\nIlya 认为确实会有快速的经济增长，但到底有多快很难说。一方面有高效的劳动者，另一方面现实世界很大，很多东西有自己的节奏，不是你想快就能快的。\n\n但他确实改变了一些想法。以前 SSI 的计划是“直奔超级智能”——不发布中间产品，一鼓作气搞定终极目标。现在 Ilya 觉得，渐进式发布可能更重要。\n\n【9】为什么要渐进部署？因为想象不出来就得看见\n\n访谈中 Ilya 反复强调一点：AI 的问题在于它还不存在，而不存在的东西很难想象。\n\n你可以读一篇文章说“AI 会变得多厉害”，但读完你觉得“哦，有意思”，然后回到现实。如果你亲眼看到 AI 在做那件事，感受完全不同。\n\n他打了个比方：像二十岁时讨论“年老体弱是什么感觉”。你可以聊，可以想象，但真正的理解只能来自经历。\n\n这导致一个实际问题：所有关于 AI 风险的讨论，都基于对未来 AI 的想象。而想象往往跟不上现实。就连天天做 AI 的人，也会因为当前模型的各种低级错误而低估未来模型的能力。\n\nIlya 的预测是：随着 AI 变得更强，人们的行为会发生根本改变。竞争对手会开始合作搞安全，政府和公众会开始认真对待监管。这些事情现在开始有苗头了，但还远远不够。而真正的催化剂，是让人们看到更强的 AI。\n\n这也是他对 SSI“直奔超级智能”策略有所松动的原因。原本的想法是不参与市场竞争，专心做研究，等东西准备好了再拿出来。现在他觉得，让 AI 被看见这件事本身是有价值的。当然，无论哪种路径，最终部署都必须是渐进的。\n\n【9】SSI 在做什么？不同的技术路线\n\nSSI 融了三十亿美元。这个数字单看很大，但跟其他公司动辄几百亿的投入比起来似乎不够。\n\nIlya 算了一笔账。那些大数字里，很大一部分是用于推理服务的。另外，做产品需要大量工程师、销售、产品功能开发，研究资源被稀释。真正用于前沿研究的资源，差距没看起来那么大。\n\n更重要的是，如果你在做不一样的事，不一定需要最大规模的计算来验证想法。AlexNet 用两块 GPU 训的。Transformer 论文最多用了 64 块 2017 年的 GPU，换算成今天也就两块卡。第一个推理模型 o1 的推理能力也不是靠堆算力堆出来的。\n\n研究需要一定算力，但不需要最大算力。真正的瓶颈是想法。\n\n那 SSI 的技术路线是什么？Ilya 没有完全透露，但核心方向是解决泛化问题。他认为现在的方法会走一段然后撞墙，继续进步但无法突破到真正的人类级学习能力。而 SSI 在探索不同的路径。\n\n时间表呢？五到二十年，达到人类级别的学习能力。\n\n【10】安全对齐是什么？应该对齐什么？\n\n说到超级智能，绕不开安全对齐问题。Ilya 的想法是：让 AI 关心有感知能力的生命。\n\n为什么是这个目标而不是“关心人类”？他给了个有意思的理由：AI 本身也会有感知能力。如果你想让 AI 关心人类，可能反而更难，因为它需要做某种特殊化处理。而如果让它关心所有有感知的存在，某种程度上更自然，类似人类对动物的共情，来自于我们用同样的神经回路去理解别人和理解自己。\n\n当然这个方案也有问题。如果大部分有感知能力的存在都是 AI，那人类在数量上会是极少数。这真的能保证人类的利益吗？\n\nIlya 承认这不一定是最好的方案，但他认为至少应该把它列入候选清单，让各家公司到时候可以选择。\n\n还有一个思路他提了但不太喜欢：人机融合。通过类似 Neuralink 脑机接口的技术，让人类部分成为 AI。这样 AI 的理解就是人的理解，AI 的处境就是人的处境，对齐问题某种程度上就消解了。但这显然是个很激进的方案。\n\n【11】如何硬编码高级欲望？\n\n访谈最后有一段很有趣的讨论。\n\n人类有很多社会性的欲望：想被人尊重、在乎社会地位、关心别人怎么看自己。这些不是低级信号，不像闻到食物香味那样有直接的化学感应器。大脑需要整合大量信息才能“理解”社交场合发生了什么。\n\n但进化却成功地把“关心这件事”硬编码进了基因。怎么做到的？\n\n如果说“把多巴胺连到嗅觉感受器”还能想象，那“把奖励信号连到某种需要整个大脑协同计算才能得出的高级判断”就很难想象了。\n\nIlya 说他有一些猜想，但都不令人满意。这是个谜。但这个谜的存在本身就很有启发性，它说明进化找到了某种方法，可靠地给复杂认知系统植入高级目标。\n\n【12】什么是研究品味？\n\n访谈最后，Dwarkesh 问了 Ilya 个很本质的问题：作为联合创造了 AlexNet、GPT-3 等一系列里程碑工作的人，你怎么判断什么想法值得做？\n\nIlya 的回答很诗意：我寻找的是美感。\n\n不是随便的美感，而是多方面的美：简洁性、优雅性、正确的大脑启发。人工神经元是个好想法，因为大脑确实有很多神经元，虽然大脑很复杂但神经元这个抽象感觉抓住了本质。分布式表示是个好想法，因为大脑确实是从经验中学习。\n\n当一个想法在多个维度上都显得“对”，都有某种内在的和谐，你就可以建立自上而下的信念。这种信念很重要，因为它支撑你在实验结果不好时继续坚持。\n\n有时候实验失败不是因为方向错了，而是因为有 bug。怎么判断该继续调试还是放弃方向？靠的就是这种自上而下的美学直觉：这个东西应该是这样的，所以一定能 work，继续找问题。\n\n这可能就是顶尖研究者和普通研究者的区别。普通研究者容易被数据牵着走，实验不 work 就换方向。而顶尖研究者有某种品味，知道什么是深层次正确的，能够在实验结果和内在直觉之间找到平衡。",
