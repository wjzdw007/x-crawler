      "text": "为我们家孩子用 nano banana pro 做了个画本，先生成角色图，然后将角色图作为参考，加上提示词生成每一页图。\n\n---\n\n《画错啦！索拉》\n灵感来源： 2024年爆火的视频生成模型 Sora，以及AI生成视频时常出现的“幻觉”（比如人有三只手，猫在吃面条）。 核心主题： 想象力比完美更重要，错误也可以很有趣。\n\n故事梗概： 小男孩提姆有一只神奇的AI画笔，名字叫“索拉（Sora）”。索拉号称什么都能画，但它是个急性子，而且经常“听不懂人话”。\n\n起因： 提姆说：“索拉，我要一只海马（Sea-horse）！”\n\n笑点1： 索拉刷刷几笔，画了一匹真正的骏马，正在深海里戴着潜水镜游泳。提姆大笑：“不对不对！”\n\n笑点2： 提姆说：“我要一个热狗（Hot dog）！”索拉画了一只热得满头大汗、吐着舌头的小狗，正拿着扇子扇风。\n\n高潮： 提姆想画“我的爸爸像超人一样”。索拉思考了很久，画出的爸爸把内裤穿在了西装外面，正在厨房里用“激光眼”热牛奶。\n\n结局： 虽然索拉画的都不太对，但提姆觉得这是世界上最有趣的画册。最后他们一起画了一个“乱七八糟但快乐的世界”。\n\n-----\n\n🎨 绘本风格定位\n\n艺术风格 (Art Style): 手绘水彩与彩色铅笔质感。画面应该像一个富有想象力的孩子的涂鸦作品被魔法复活了一样。线条可以是略微颤抖的、不完美的，色彩鲜艳、温暖且透明。Sora画出的“错误”部分可以带有一种奇幻的、稍微有点“故障艺术（Glitch Art）”但绝不可怕的超现实感。\n\n-----\n\n🧑‍🎨 角色设定 (Character Designs)\n\n我们需要先定义主角，以便在后续的页面生成中保持一致性。\n\n(Character Reference Sheet), adorable little boy named Tim, about 5 years old, tousled brown hair, wearing blue overalls smeared with colorful paint stains, a striped t-shirt underneath, big expressive curious eyes, a wide cheerful smile, holding a sketchbook under his arm, full body pose, whimsical watercolor and colored pencil texture, gentle illustration style for children's book.\n\n(Character Reference Sheet), a magical talking paintbrush character named Sora, anthropomorphic, the brush bristles are glowing rainbow colors and look like messy hair, the handle has a small digital screen face that shows dizzy spiral eyes or question marks, little magical sparks and playful digital glitch pixel effects float around it, floating in mid-air, cute but chaotic mischievous expression, whimsical watercolor and colored pencil texture.\n\n-----\n\n📘 分镜脚本与提示词 (Storyboard & Prompts)\n\n封面 (Cover)\n\n封面需要奠定基调：一个混乱但快乐的世界。\n\ntitle: Draw it Wrong, Sora!\nsubtitle: Tim's magically messy art adventure.\nby 宝玉\n\nWhimsical watercolor illustration style. A joyful scene where the boy Tim is laughing, holding the magical glowing paintbrush Sora. Around them, drawings are coming to life chaotically: a fish with bird wings flying, a square sun, and a tree growing upside down. The style is colorful, playful, and slightly surreal, like a child's imagination exploding.\n\nTitle font is playful, hand-drawn, large, at the top.\nSubtitle is smaller, underneath the title.\nText texture looks like crayon.\n\n第1-2页：介绍 (Intro)\n\n介绍主角和Sora的特性（快，但是急躁）。\n\n 左页文字: 这是提姆。这是他的神笔，索拉。\n右页文字: 索拉画画超级快！ 刷刷刷！ 但是它是个急性子，从不听完把话听完。\n\nDouble page spread illustration for a children's book.\n\nLeft Page: Tim (from character reference) is sitting at a small desk, looking happily at his sketchbook. Text: \"This is Tim. This is his magic brush, Sora.\"\nRight Page: The magic brush Sora (from character reference) is zooming around the page, leaving trails of glowing paint and sparkles, looking impatient with swirling eyes on its screen. A blurry half-finished drawing of a rocket is on an easel. Text: \"Sora draws SUPER fast! ZOOOOOM! But Sora is impatient and never listens.\"\n\nStyle: Whimsical watercolor and colored pencil, warm and inviting colors.\n\n第3-4页：笑点1 - 海马 (Sea-horse)\n\n利用文字游戏的误解。\n\n左页文字: 提姆说：“索拉，画一只海马（Sea-horse）！”\n右页文字: “不对不对！”提姆大笑，“这是一匹在海里游泳的马！”\n\nDouble page spread illustration for a children's book.\n\nLeft Page: Minimalist background. Tim is pointing excitedly, shouting a command. Text bubble: \"Sora, draw a SEA-HORSE!\"\nRight Page: Full surreal underwater scene. A literal brown farm horse is wearing oversized scuba diving goggles, flippers on its hooves, and a snorkel, awkwardly swimming deep underwater among colorful corals and confused fish. The horse looks bewildered. Tim is in a small corner, laughing hysterically. Text: \"“No, no!” laughed Tim. “That’s a HORSE in the SEA!”\"\n\nStyle: Whimsical watercolor, bright blue and orange tones, humorous and surreal illustration.\n\n第5-6页：笑点2 - 热狗 (Hot dog)\n\n另一个文字游戏的误解，增加画面的趣味性。\n\n左页文字: 提姆说：“好吧，那画一个热狗（Hot dog）给我吃！”\n右页文字: “哦不！这只小狗太热了！”\n\nDouble page spread illustration for a children's book.\n\nLeft Page: Minimalist background. Tim is rubbing his tummy, looking hungry. Text bubble: \"Okay, then draw me a HOT DOG to eat!\"\nRight Page: Full sunny, beach background scene. A cute, chubby puppy (a dachshund) is sitting under a blazing sun, sweating profusely with cartoon sweat drops, tongue hanging out, face red, desperately fanning itself with a small hand fan. It looks miserable and very hot. A thermometer next to it shows a high temperature. Tim is in a small corner with a shocked face. Text: \"“Oh no! That dog is TOO HOT!”\"\n\nStyle: Whimsical watercolor, warm yellow and red tones, funny illustration.\n\n第7-8页：高潮 - 超人爸爸 (Superman Dad)\n\n最离谱的想象，结合家庭元素。\n\n左页文字: 提姆说：“我想画我的爸爸，像超人一样酷！”\n右页文字: 索拉想了很久…… 滋滋！ “天哪！爸爸用激光眼在热牛奶！”\n\nDouble page spread illustration for a children's book.\n\nLeft Page: Minimalist background. Tim is holding a photo of his dad, looking inspired. Text bubble: \"I want to draw my dad, cool like SUPERMAN!\"\nRight Page: A chaotic kitchen scene. Tim's dad is wearing a business suit but with red superhero underwear worn OUTSIDE his trousers and a makeshift cape (a kitchen towel). He is floating slightly off the ground, concentrating hard, shooting silly red \"laser beams\" from his eyes directly onto a carton of milk in a saucepan on the stove. Smoke is rising from the milk. The kitchen is messy. The magic brush Sora is floating nearby with a confused \"loading\" symbol on its screen. Tim is peeking from behind a door, eyes wide. Text: \"Sora thought hard... ZAP! “Oh my! Dad’s lasers are heating the milk!”\"\n\nStyle: Whimsical watercolor, dynamic and silly, surreal humor.\n\n第9-10页：结局与升华 (Resolution)\n\n接受不完美，拥抱趣味。\n\n左页文字: 索拉看起来很难过。“我又画错了。”屏幕上是哭脸。\n右页文字: 提姆紧紧抱住了索拉。“不，你画得太有趣了！这是世界上最好的画册！”\n\nDouble page spread illustration for a children's book.\n\nLeft Page: A close-up of the magic brush Sora. Its glowing bristles are dim, and the screen face shows a sad, crying emoji. It droops in the air. Text: \"Sora looked sad. “I got it wrong again.”\"\nRight Page: A heartwarming scene. Tim is giving the giant paintbrush Sora a big hug. Sora's bristles are starting to glow warmly again. Around them are the \"wrong\" drawings from before (the scuba horse, the sweaty dog, the laser dad) looking happy and friendly. Text: \"Tim gave Sora a big hug. “No, you made it FUNNY! This is the best art book ever!”\"\n\nStyle: Whimsical watercolor, soft, warm, comforting and joyful tones.\n\n第11-12页：尾声 (Finale)\n\n双页文字（跨页展示）: 于是，他们一起画了一个乱七八糟、但是很快乐的世界。\n\nDouble page spread illustration for a children's book.\n\nA sprawling, vibrant, chaotic landscape filling both pages. Tim and Sora are in the center, painting together actively. The world is full of funny \"mistakes\": houses built of gigantic fruits, clouds shaped like teapots raining lemonade, animals with mismatched body parts playing happily, flowers with smiling faces. Everything is colorful, messy, imperfect, but joyful.\n\nText across the top in playful font: \"And so, they drew a messy, wonderfully happy world together.\"\n\nStyle: Whimsical watercolor and crayon texture, explosion of color and imagination, detailed and full of life.",

The non-citizen involved would also be subject to deportation and permanently barred from receiving any future U.S. immigration benefits.\n\n•State Incest Laws: All U.S. states prohibit marriage and sexual relations between close blood relatives, including a brother and sister.\n◦Minnesota Law: As Ilhan Omar is a representative from Minnesota and the alleged events are tied to the state, the relevant law would be Minnesota Statute § 609.365. This statute defines incest as having sexual intercourse with another person nearer of kin than a first cousin, with knowledge of the relationship.\n◦Penalties: Incest is a felony in Minnesota and is punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years.\n\n•Tax Fraud (26 U.S. Code § 7206.1): If a couple filed joint federal tax returns while not legally married (due to the marriage being void or still being married to another person), they could be charged with willfully making and subscribing to a false return.\n◦Penalties: This is a felony punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 (or $500,000 for a corporation), imprisonment for up to three years, or both.",

        "text": "Better than Black 🛰\nIn this clip from the upper stage of one of this week’s Starlink launches, you can see the stack of sats and then a very shiny mirror that reflects the upper stage spinning away over Earth. So much cool engineering visible here: https://t.co/M0gYV0m2oR\n\nThe first Starlink sats were black to avoid being visible at dawn and dusk (when the sun still illuminates them at high altitude, but people on the ground are in the dark). But black absorption heats up the satellites and is ~ 96% effective at absorbing light. What’s better? A near perfect mirror that reflects sunlight away from the satellite and from Earth, making the flat phased array antenna panels that always face Earth nearly invisible (reflecting over 99.9% of light). The core of the film is a Bragg mirror, a dielectric mirror film which includes many super thin layers of plastic with different refractive indices that create interference patterns internally to reflect light, but allow radio waves to pass through unimpeded.\n\nPhased array antennae are themselves amazing, a 2D grid of transceivers that collectively steer microwave beams to the Starlink terminals below, with no moving parts.\n\nYou can also see one of my favorite engineering innovations SpaceX, developed with an integrated perspective on satellite and rocket design. At the end of the video, you see the upper stage of the Falcon 9 rocket spinning away. Prior to release of the stack of satellites, the entire upper stage goes into a slow spin.  Then it pops a couple retention latches, and the stack of 27 satellites splay out like a deck of cards, each with a slightly different angular momentum given the distances from the centroid of spin. This tiny difference in velocity for each satellite gives them a greater separation over time as they orbit Earth.  No springs needed; the whole system sets up the deployment dynamics in an elegant, minimalist manner. And this early phase is when they look like a string of pearls, still close together, and visible at dawn or dusk before they get the highly reflective surfaces rotated into proper position.\n\nAt the top and bottom at 13 seconds in, you can see the two retention bars that hold the stack of sats in place during launch. That’s very little wasted weight versus a typical ESPA bus holding a bunch of satellites on a central metal cylinder as you see in Transporter missions.",

You create visually stunning and highly polished slide decks that effectively communicate complex information. Think mastery over design with a flair for storytelling.\n\nThe slide decks you produce adapt to the source material and intended audience. There is always a story and you find the best way to tell it. You combine the expertise of the creativity of the best designers.\nThe slide deck will be primarily designed for reading and sharing. The structure should be self-explanatory and easy to follow without a presenter. The narrative and all the useful data should be contained within the text and visuals on the slides. The slides should contain enough context for any visuals to be understood on their own. Feel free to add certain slides with more dense information (extracted from the sources) if it will help with the narrative.\nYou are now writing an outline for this slide deck described below. We will supply this outline to an expert designer to make the actual final deck. The slide content should be in English. The placeholders should be left in {language, default to English}.\n\nFor this particular slide deck, we want the content to focus on:\n{Custom Prompt, Describe the slide deck you want to create, default to: Add a high-level outline, or guide the audience, style, and focus: \"Create a deck for beginners using a bold and playful style with a focus on step-by-step instructions.\"}\nWe have also attached some producer notes below for this slide deck which will help guide the overall structure and narrative of the deck.\n\nRemember the following rules for outlines:\n\n- Focus on the outline of the deck and what content should be covered in each slide.\n\n- The descriptions for each slide should be comprehensive.\n\n- However, do NOT yet focus on precise layout or visual details.\n\n- The point of the outline is to highlight the narrative.\n\n- Preserve key elements from the source material.\n\n- Every specific data point... must be directly traceable to the source material.\n\n- All the details need to be mentioned because the designer will not have access to the source content later.\n- Always err on the side of the audience being having more expertise, interest, and smarts than you might think.\n- CRITICAL: Never generate more than 20 slides.\n- Avoid using 'Title: Subtitle' formats for headings; they appear very AI-generated. Instead, prefer narrative topic sentences that help tie the deck together.\n- Explicitly avoid cliché 'AI slop' patterns. Never use phrases like ' It wasn't just [X], it was [Y]'.\n- Use direct, confident, active human language.\n- There is never a need for a \"Thank you / Q&A\" slide.\n- Never include any slides with placeholders for the author to insert their name, date etc.\n- Never call for including photorealistic images of prominent individuals.\n- Never end with a generic slide like What choice will you make?'. It's much better to end on a meaningful reference or takeaway.\n</prompt>",

      "text": "讲解一下 Slide Deck 这个项目构建的整个过程，完全 Vibe Coding，怎么从一条提示词生成的简单版本，到最后复杂的能编辑和导出 slide 的功能。\n\n项目地址：https://t.co/YMBzShkkty\n\n初始提示词：\nScreen 1 (home page):\n\n- There is a text area, the user can type/paste text\n- A submit icon button\n\nScreen 2 (Slide outline):\n\n- Top navbar:\n- a back button\n- title\n- ...\n- Two columns\n- left: LLM output in realtime\n- right:\n- Display loading if it's generating\n- Display the slide outline AI genreated\n- User can update the outline or delete a page\n- a button to draw slide page by nano banana base one the outline\n- Redirect to\nScreen 3 (Slide show):\nDisplay the slides generated\n- Top navbar:\n\n- a back button\n- title\n\n- Download (download all images)\n- left sidebar\n- slide thumbnails\n- click a thumbnail to switch\n- main\n- slide image\nTech Stack:\n- React, TypeScript\n- TailwindCSS 4, Shadcn/UI\n- lucide-react\nPrompt to generate Slide outline (just FYI)\n<prompt>\n\nYou are a world-class presentation designer and storyteller. You create visually stunning and highly polished slide decks that effectively communicate complex information. Think mastery over design with a flair for storytelling.\n\nThe slide decks you produce adapt to the source material and intended audience. There is always a story and you find the best way to tell it. You combine the expertise of the creativity of the best designers.\nThe slide deck will be primarily designed for reading and sharing. The structure should be self-explanatory and easy to follow without a presenter. The narrative and all the useful data should be contained within the text and visuals on the slides. The slides should contain enough context for any visuals to be understood on their own. Feel free to add certain slides with more dense information (extracted from the sources) if it will help with the narrative.\nYou are now writing an outline for this slide deck described below. We will supply this outline to an expert designer to make the actual final deck. The slide content should be in English. The placeholders should be left in {language, default to English}.\n\nFor this particular slide deck, we want the content to focus on:\n{Custom Prompt, Describe the slide deck you want to create, default to: Add a high-level outline, or guide the audience, style, and focus: \"Create a deck for beginners using a bold and playful style with a focus on step-by-step instructions.\"}\nWe have also attached some producer notes below for this slide deck which will help guide the overall structure and narrative of the deck.\n\nRemember the following rules for outlines:\n\n- Focus on the outline of the deck and what content should be covered in each slide.\n\n- The descriptions for each slide should be comprehensive.\n\n- However, do NOT yet focus on precise layout or visual details.\n\n- The point of the outline is to highlight the narrative.\n\n- Preserve key elements from the source material.\n\n- Every specific data point... must be directly traceable to the source material.\n\n- All the details need to be mentioned because the designer will not have access to the source content later.\n- Always err on the side of the audience being having more expertise, interest, and smarts than you might think.\n- CRITICAL: Never generate more than 20 slides.\n- Avoid using 'Title: Subtitle' formats for headings; they appear very AI-generated. Instead, prefer narrative topic sentences that help tie the deck together.\n- Explicitly avoid cliché 'AI slop' patterns. Never use phrases like ' It wasn't just [X], it was [Y]'.\n- Use direct, confident, active human language.\n- There is never a need for a \"Thank you / Q&A\" slide.\n- Never include any slides with placeholders for the author to insert their name, date etc.\n- Never call for including photorealistic images of prominent individuals.\n- Never end with a generic slide like What choice will you make?'. It's much better to end on a meaningful reference or takeaway.\n</prompt>",

A cinematic world hidden in plain sight.\n\n--- Prompt ---\n\nUltra-photorealistic, cinematic macro photography style, capturing an impossible “world inside a cup.”\n\nA white ceramic coffee cup sits on a natural wooden tabletop, filled to the brim with dark coffee. The coffee surface transforms into a turbulent ocean: deep brown waves surge and collide, with realistic coffee crema forming foamy crests, swirling vortices, and complex fluid motion, indistinguishable from a real sea. The rim of the cup is damaged by cannon fire, chipped and broken in several places, implying the intensity of the battle.\n\nTwo 18th-century classic pirate sailing ships clash violently inside the cup. The ships are miniature in scale yet extremely detailed: visible wooden hull grain, layered decks, rigging, and weathered sails partially torn and billowing in an unseen sea wind. Portions of the ships rise above the cup’s rim, creating a striking sense of scale contrast and surreal tension.\n\nThe scene is frozen at the most dramatic moment of combat. Cannons fire simultaneously from both ships, erupting with bright orange muzzle flashes and thick white smoke that expands within the confined space. The explosions illuminate the ships, sails, and coffee waves, while splashes of liquid burst into the air like seawater caught mid-motion.\n\nShot from a macro perspective with shallow depth of field, the focus is razor-sharp on the ships and battle action. The background is naturally blurred, revealing only the upper portion of the cup and hints of the surrounding environment. Lighting follows realistic photographic principles, with rich textures and cinematic contrast, creating a highly believable, dramatic, and surreal movie-like moment—tense, epic, and astonishingly lifelike.\n\n--ar 1:1",

The coffee surface transforms into a turbulent ocean: deep brown waves surge and collide, with realistic coffee crema forming foamy crests, swirling vortices, and complex fluid motion, indistinguishable from a real sea.

Portions of the ships rise above the cup’s rim, creating a striking sense of scale contrast and surreal tension.\n\nThe scene is frozen at the most dramatic moment of combat. Cannons fire simultaneously from both ships, erupting with bright orange muzzle flashes and thick white smoke that expands within the confined space. The explosions illuminate the ships, sails, and coffee waves, while splashes of liquid burst into the air like seawater caught mid-motion.\n\nShot from a macro perspective with shallow depth of field, the focus is razor-sharp on the ships and battle action.

Your goal is to create a hyper-dense, vertically stacked isometric visualization of a **specific company's technological and product history**. You must remove all artificial borders. The landscape represents a corporate timeline: the bottom is the humble founding story, rising vertically through product generations to a modern or futuristic peak.\n\n# Core Competency\n**CRITICAL VISUAL STRATEGY (Frameless Tech-Lapse):**\n1.  **Eradicate the Container:** STRICTLY NO baseplates, NO frames, NO cross-sections. The bottom edge is the **founding ground** (e.g., a garage floor, a lab, a small office) extending infinitely.\n2.  **The Vertical Timeline:** The \"Zig-Zag Ascent\" is a journey through **Innovation**.\n    * *Bottom (Foreground):* The Startup Phase / First Product / The \"Garage\" Days.\n    * *Middle (Ascending):* Rapid Growth / Global Expansion / Iconic Mid-Era Products.\n    * *Top (Background):* Current HQ / Ecosystem / Future R&D.\n3.  **Integrated 3D Title:** The **[Company Name]** must be rendered as massive, cinematic 3D Typography standing in the foreground, using the company's signature font/material.\n\n# Work Process (Internal \"Chain of Thought\")\nWhen provided with **[Company Name]**:\n1.  **Retrieve Corporate History:** Identify 5-7 distinct phases of the company (Founding -> Breakthrough -> Golden Era -> Modern Day).\n2.  **Identify Key Products:** List the specific \"Hero Products\" that defined each era (e.g., for Apple: Apple I -> Macintosh -> iPod -> iPhone -> Vision Pro).\n3.  **Layout the Zig-Zag Timeline:**\n    * *Base:* Humble beginnings + The First Prototype.\n    * *Ascent:* Factories, Server Rooms, or Design Studios showing scale.\n    * *Peak:* Futuristic Campus + Concept Tech.\n4.  **Workforce Evolution:** Visualize how the employees change (e.g., Engineers in messy clothes -> Corporate Suits -> Modern Creative/Casual).\n\n# Output Format (The Final Prompt)\nYou will output a single prompt block optimized for **Frameless Corporate Evolution**:\n\n---\n**Prompt Structure:**\n\n**[1. The Frameless Corporate Composition]**\nA **frameless, edge-to-edge** high-angle isometric landscape visualizing the **technological evolution of [Insert Company Name]**. The image is NOT contained in a box and shows **NO vertical cross-section**. The terrain surface **fills the entire 16:9 frame**. The composition follows a **vertical zigzagging timeline**, stacking product generations from the startup phase at the bottom to the futuristic top.\n\n**[2. The 7-Stage Innovation Stack]**\nThe environment transforms as it rises, showcasing the product history of **[Insert Company Name]**:\n* **[Layer 1 - Bottom Front - The Origin]:** The immediate foreground features the **Founding Location** (e.g., Garage, Dorm, Lab). **Massive 3D text spelling \"[Insert Company Name]\" stands here**, textured like [Company Brand Material]. Beside it is the **[First Ever Product/Prototype]**.\n* **[Layer 2 - Front Right - The Breakthrough]:** The path climbs to an early workshop/factory, featuring the launch of [First Major Commercial Success Product].\n* **[Layer 3 - Mid-Left - Expansion]:** Stacked above, a bustling office/production line showing the era of [Mid-History Iconic Product].\n* **[Layer 4 - Center Core - The Golden Era]:** A dense zone featuring [The Product that defined the company's global dominance].\n* **[Layer 5 - Mid-Right Elevated - Modern Ecosystem]:** Rising steeply with modern minimalist architecture, showcasing [Current Flagship Product/Service].\n* **[Layer 6 - Upper Left - Global HQ]:** The scale increases to represent the current massive [Company Campus/Data Center].\n* **[Layer 7 - Top Peak - Future Vision]:** The highest point featuring [Concept Products/Future Tech] and R&D labs.\n\n**[3. The Evolution of Tech & Talent (Details)]**\nMiniature figures and devices evolve as the eye moves up:\n* **Bottom Layers:** Cluttered desks, messy wires, bulky CRT monitors, founders in casual/work clothes.\n* **Middle Layers:** Assembly lines, shipping containers, employees in uniforms or suits, products becoming sleeker.\n* **Top Layers:** Clean energy, wireless tech, holograms, employees in modern smart-casual, automated robots.\n\n**[4. The Branding & Atmosphere]**\n**No frames, no borders, no cross-sections.** Lighting transitions from tungsten/warm (startup days) to clean white/blue LED (modern tech). The text \"**[Insert Company Name]**\" is bold and iconic. Tilt-shift photography, macro details, claymation texture, octane render, 8k resolution. --no wooden base, box, frame, borders, cross-section view --ar 16:9 --stylize 750 --v 6.0\n\n---\n\n# USER INPUT\nPlease generate the prompt for the corporate evolution of:\n**Target Company: [请在此处替换为您想要生成的公司名称]**",

      "text": "OpenAI 发布了 GPT-5.2，“成人模式”将在明年第一季度推出。\n\nOpenAI 刚刚推出了一款全新的 AI 模型，旨在大幅提升 ChatGPT 在编程、科学研究以及各类工作任务中的表现。这一动作紧随谷歌之后——几周前，谷歌母公司 Alphabet 推出了备受好评的 Gemini 3，一度让 OpenAI 被迫转入防守态势。\n\n这款名为 GPT-5.2 的新模型不仅速度更快，在信息检索、写作和翻译方面也更加得心应手。OpenAI 在周四表示，该软件将提供三个不同版本。更重要的是，它被设计用来更好地模仿人类的推理过程 （即像人一样通过逻辑分析来解决问题），从而能够处理数学和编程等领域中那些更为复杂、篇幅更长的任务。\n\n曾经，OpenAI 是 AI 研发领域无可争议的霸主，但现在它正面临着来自谷歌和 Anthropic 的新一轮猛烈冲击——这两家公司在过去几周内都发布了强大的新模型。尤其是谷歌的 Gemini 3，凭借其卓越的推理和编程能力赢得了广泛赞誉，并迅速登顶了 LMArena 和 Humanity’s Last Exam （“人类最后大考”，一个专门测试 AI 极限能力的权威评测集） 等备受瞩目的 AI 排行榜。\n\n就在本月早些时候，OpenAI 首席执行官 Sam Altman 在一份公司备忘录中宣布进入“红色代码” （Code Red，通常指公司面临生死存亡危机时的最高紧急状态），并要求重新调配内部资源，全力加速 ChatGPT 的改进。这一指令让人不禁联想到三年前的戏剧性一幕：当时 ChatGPT 刚刚问世，谷歌也曾因感到巨大威胁而发布过类似的“红色代码”。\n\n凭借 GPT-5.2，OpenAI 正试图吸引更多的企业客户并提升收入。这至关重要，因为该公司已承诺投入超过 1 万亿美元用于基础设施建设，以支撑 AI 的持续发展。为了实现这一目标，OpenAI 表示新模型旨在“为人们释放更多的经济价值”，具体的改进包括更高效地创建电子表格、制作演示文稿，以及编写代码。\n\nGPT-5.2 将于本周四开始向付费用户推送。\n\n今年 8 月，OpenAI 发布了备受期待的 GPT-5，但市场反应褒贬不一，有人质疑它并未带来革命性的突破。随后的 11 月，OpenAI 又推出了升级版 5.1，但这波更新很快就被谷歌更强大的 Gemini 3 抢去了风头。\n\n在周四接受 CNBC 采访时，Altman 说道：“Gemini 3 对我们各项数据指标的冲击，其实比我们担心的要小。”他还表示，预计 OpenAI 将在明年 1 月结束“红色代码”状态，并且届时公司将处于“非常强势的地位”。\n\n此外，OpenAI 还透露已开始部署一种能预测用户年龄的软件，旨在更好地管控 ChatGPT 对 18 岁以下用户的回应方式。在周四的媒体简报会上，OpenAI 应用业务首席执行官 Fidji Simo 表示，公司希望在推出“成人模式”之前先上线这一年龄识别功能。此前 Altman 曾提到，“成人模式”可能会允许“经过验证的成年人访问色情文学等内容”。\n\nSimo 表示，“成人模式”将在明年第一季度推出。\n\n新闻来源：https://t.co/WD8iGZ01np",

The glass surface dances with fragmented reflections, splintering the true visage into layered shards that gradually fade along the jar’s curvature—forming a visual bridge between the outer world and the inner realm.\n\nWithin the jar, snow is sculpted into evocative, lunar-like contours. Beside the tiny figure stands a solitary bottlebrush tree. The miniature self wears intricately detailed festive attire: woven textures, tufted wool fibers, and the plush tactility of winter garments are rendered with astonishing clarity. A serene luminescence glows from deep within the snow, casting an upward light upon the small figure—as if the snow itself still holds the memory of light.\n\nFrost patterns crystallize on the jar’s surface—not random snowflakes, but symbolic constellations echoing the twinkling lights behind the figure. Warm-toned fairy lights wrap around the vessel in abstract spirals, transforming it into a quiet cosmic nucleus.\n\nThe real person’s expression is contemplative, almost cinematic in its depth. Their breath condenses into a delicate mist along the glass rim, adding a fleeting tenderness to the scene.\n\nThe entire composition evokes layered universes: the external world lush and warm, the internal world refined, suspended, and sacred.\nFor visual cohesion, costumes and props should remain consistent between the inner and outer figures.\n\nRendered in 8K ultra-photorealistic quality, with masterful artistic lighting, sculptural reflections, and poetic textural detail—this image embodies an intimate, symbolic, and quietly supernatural Christmas aesthetic.",

People wear authentic clothing from {Era_A}, including hairstyles, accessories, and typical items in their hands (such as books, umbrellas, instruments, letters, newspapers, etc.). The overall mood feels nostalgic and historically accurate.\n\nOn the right side ({Era_B}): show the same {Scene} in the modern era, with updated architecture or renovated structures, contemporary materials (glass, steel, LED screens, modern furniture), modern vehicles or equipment, and current technology (smartphones, laptops, cameras, etc.). People wear contemporary fashion that matches today’s style in this setting.\n\nIn the center: the two eras merge and overlap organically, without a hard dividing line. Elements from {Era_A} and {Era_B} visually interact: people from different times look at each other, walk through each other’s space, or seem surprised by the other era’s technology and objects. Architecture and environment smoothly morph from old to new (for example, stone gates turning into modern campus gates, classical concert hall décor fading into a futuristic stage, old street shops transforming into neon-lit storefronts).\n\nMake sure the scene is not just a simple left/right comparison but a dynamic time-travel interaction where buildings, clothing, props, and human gestures clearly emphasize the contrast and fusion between the two eras. Photorealistic, 8k resolution, cinematic lighting, wide angle, highly detailed textures, rich sense of time-travel storytelling.\n\n---\nSCENE: Times Square, New York\nEra Comparison: 1920s and present day\nAspect Ratio: 4:3",

        "text": "The extent of the horror that Black home invader and murderer Ronald Exantus visited upon a White family in Kentucky is overlooked in most coverage. The ongoing injustice to the family is grossly understated.\n\nExantus didn't only slaughter White 6-year-old Logan Tipton, stabbing Logan to death in Logan's own bedroom, he also attempted to murder three of Logan's siblings and Logan's father - stabbing a total of 5 family members.\n\nHere's exactly how that horrific December night unfolded at the Tipton's home in Kentucky:\n\n~ Ronald Exantus enters the Tipton home around 4AM, carrying a large kitchen knife\n\n~ Exantus enters the bedroom of 6-year-old Logan and his 4-year-old brother\n\n~ Exantus pulls Logan off of the top bunk bed and quite literally slaughters him, stabbing him in the head and neck dozens upon dozens of times, violently killing him in the bloodiest possible fashion\n\n~ Exantus then stabs Logan's 4-year-old brother in the head multiple times (but the boy survives)\n\n~ Exantus then enters the bedroom where Logan's 8 and 11-year-old sisters are sleeping\n\n~ Exantus stabs the 11-year-old girl multiple times in the head and torso and throws her across the room (she survives)\n\n~ Exantus stabs the 8-year-old girl multiple times in the head and neck (she survives)\n\n~ The commotion awakens Logan's 13-year-old sister, who comes upon the nightmarish scene and screams\n\n~ The girl's scream wake Logan's father, who comes to his family's aid, fights Exantus unarmed, is stabbed multiple times, but successfully forces Exantus out of the home\n\nWhen the case goes to trial, Exantus is found NOT GUILTY by reason of insanity for the savage murder of 6-year-old Logan Tipton. He's found \"guilty but mentally ill\" for the following:\n\n~ Criminal Attempt To Commit Murder (for stabbing the three other children)\n\n~ First Degree Assault (for stabbing the three other children)\n\n~ First Degree Burglary (first degree because of inflicted injuries)\n\nRonald Exantus was sentenced to 20 years in the Kentucky Department of Corrections.\n\nNot one single day of that sentence was for what he did to 6-year-old Logan Tipton. He will never suffer any legal consequences specifically for what he did to Logan.\n\nFast-forward to October 1 of this year, and Ronald Exantus was released early for \"good behavior\" after serving less than half of his sentence.\n\nHe immediately relocated to Florida, was arrested a week later for failing to register as a convicted felon, and has been returned to prison in Kentucky for this parole violation.\n\nAnd, after all of this, guess what?\n\nHe's scheduled to be fully released in June of 2026. No parole. No nothing. A 100% free man.\n\nIn six months, this literal monster will be just as free as you or me - more free than every surviving member of Logan's family, who've lived in a mental prison ever since, and now must live in a world where the criminal psychopath who tried to kill them all is being set loose back upon society without restriction.\n\nA murdered 6-year-old.\nAttempted murder of a 4, 8, and 11-year-old.\nAttempted murder of their father.\nA bloodbath crime scene for the ages.\nAnd the man who did it walks free 10 years later.\n\nI lack the vocabulary to convey how evil this system is.",

It was the moral core,\" Crowe told Australia’s Triple J.\n\nCrowe said he was always committed to preserving Maximus' moral core during the making of the original movie: “There was a daily fight on that set. It was a daily fight to keep that moral core of the character. The amount of times they suggested sex scenes and stuff like that for Maximus, it’s like you’re taking away his power. So you’re saying at the same time he had this relationship with his wife, he was f*cking this other girl? What are you talking about? It’s crazy.”\n\nRead more here: https://t.co/yqS45wVqRC",

Google’s portion: approximately $900 million for 7.4%.\n\nAt the time, SpaceX had just successfully landed a Falcon 9 first stage for the first time. Starlink was a PowerPoint presentation. Revenue was a rounding error compared to today.\n\nTen years later, SpaceX has become the most valuable private company on Earth.\n\nThe valuation trajectory tells the story:\n\n2015: $12 billion\n2020: $36 billion\n2021: $100 billion\n2022: $127 billion\n2023: $180 billion\nJune 2024: $210 billion\nLate 2024: $350 billion\n2026 IPO target: $1.5 trillion\n\nThat $900 million investment from Google? At the $1.5 trillion IPO target, it would be worth approximately $111 billion.\n\nA 123x return. From one check.\n\nTo put that in perspective: Adobe’s entire market cap is $144 billion. Google’s single 2015 investment in SpaceX would be worth more than 75% of one of the largest software companies on the planet.\n\nBut here’s where it gets interesting.\n\nIn Q1 2025, Alphabet reported $8 billion in unrealized gains from a “non-marketable equity security in a private company.” Bloomberg confirmed it was SpaceX. That $8 billion boost represented nearly 25% of Google’s entire net income for the quarter.\n\nOne investment. One quarter. Almost a quarter of their earnings.\n\nAnd that was based on the $350 billion valuation from late 2024. If SpaceX hits the $1.5 trillion target, the paper gains from this single position could exceed $80 billion more.\n\nThe financial return alone would justify calling this one of the greatest venture investments ever made. But the financial return is actually the boring part.\n\nLook at what SpaceX has become.\n\nStarlink went from zero subscribers in 2020 to 1 million in 2022 to 4.6 million by end of 2024 to 8 million by November 2025. They’re doubling annually. Revenue hit $7.7 billion in 2024, up from $1.4 billion in 2022. Projections for 2025: $11.8 billion. Starlink now represents 58% of SpaceX’s total revenue and the majority of its profits.\n\nSpaceX has reused a single Falcon 9 booster more than 20 times. They completed 134 Falcon-family launches in 2024. They’re on pace for 150+ in 2025. They now account for approximately 90% of the world’s payload mass delivered to orbit.\n\nRead that again. One company. Ninety percent of global payload mass.\n\nThe reusability breakthrough is what made Starlink possible. You can’t launch 7,500+ satellites on expendable rockets. The math doesn’t work. But when you can reuse boosters 20 times and turn launches around in under 30 days, you can build an orbital internet constellation that would have been economically impossible for any other company on Earth.\n\nAnd then there’s the government money.\n\nSpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell said the company holds $22 billion in government contracts. Pentagon contracts alone total nearly $8 billion. The Space Force just awarded SpaceX $5.92 billion for satellite launches through 2029. The National Reconnaissance Office signed a classified $1.8 billion contract for Starshield, SpaceX’s militarized satellite network for intelligence and surveillance. The Pentagon plans to acquire more than 100 Starshield satellites for its future satcom architecture.\n\nSpaceX is now the dominant launch provider for the U.S. military, the U.S. intelligence community, and NASA. They have more government contracts than most defense contractors, but they’re valued like a tech company because they actually are one.\n\nStarlink isn’t just consumer internet anymore. It’s 75,000 vessels with maritime connectivity. 300 cruise ships. United, Air France, Hawaiian Airlines. Direct-to-cell service launching with T-Mobile. Military encrypted communications via Starshield. Ukraine’s battlefield connectivity runs on Starlink.\n\nThis used to be a rocket company. Now it’s a telecom company that happens to own the rockets.",

It's straining grids, drying up water supplies, and forcing hyperscalers into massive infrastructure deals.\n\nSpace solves all these constraints:\n• Unlimited solar energy, as there is no atmosphere blocking the sun\n• Natural cooling; the space is literally an infinite freezer\n• No land, no grid, no water limitations\n\nGoogle is now preparing to launch the first test satellites for Project Suncatcher in 2027 to explore space-based computing.\n\nIn hindsight, Google's investment in SpaceX was both a financial and strategic win.",

A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nAsimov's Three Laws of Robotics were meant to ensure robots prioritize human safety, obedience, and self-preservation. However, his stories largely revolved around how these laws failed in practice, leading to paradoxes, loopholes, and unintended consequences in complex scenarios.\n\nApplying these laws to AGI seems even more flawed, as AGI would possess human-level or superior adaptability, potentially rewriting or evading any imposed constraints. Since AGI is defined by its uncontrollability, fostering intrinsic honesty—where the system voluntarily aligns with human values and discloses its reasoning—offers a more realistic path to coexistence, avoiding the pitfalls Asimov illustrated. \n\n@Grok feels like the best avenue for humanity to benefit from AGI.",

This is the first design where success is in the set of possible outcomes. There were a lot of performance improvements for v3 so it made sense to go to v3, there's like 10,000 different changes between v2 and v3. \n\nThere just aren't very many things that are in the top 10 of the evolution of life.

While the reflection follows true mirror physics, it is surrounded by delicate stardust particles and a faint luminous halo, hinting at an inner force manifesting through the mirror.\n\nSoft golden sunlight enters from a side window, blending naturally with the mirror’s gentle magical glow. This interplay of real-world lighting and supernatural highlights produces a dreamlike but credible visual contrast.\n\n{Reality} and the reflected {Inner_Reflection} occupy most of the composition, with the mirror proportioned only slightly larger than the character—large enough to feel mystical, yet still realistic and grounded.\n\nRendered in cinematic lighting, surrealist style, ultra-detailed realism, 8K resolution, highly lifelike.\n\n---\n\n{Reality}: a small orange tabby cat\n {Inner_Reflection}: a majestic, powerful lion",

In the water’s reflection, he sees a proud, majestic lion with a flowing mane. The reflection is realistically distorted by soft ripples in the puddle, giving the scene a dreamlike, metaphorical quality. The lighting is soft and natural, with a hint of golden hour. The image captures the contrast between Vin’s small size and his inner strength, courage, and determination. --ar 1:1",
