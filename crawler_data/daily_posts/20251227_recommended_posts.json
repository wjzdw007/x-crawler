DRIVER WALKS AWAY\n\nThis is absolutely insane.\n\nA Tesla Model Y plunged off an approximately 800-meter cliff in China, tumbling down a mountainside. \n\nThe vehicle was completely destroyed, windows shattered, body mangled beyond recognition.\n\nBut the A- and B-pillars held. \n\nThe passenger cabin didn't collapse. \n\nThe battery didn't ignite.\n\nThe driver suffered only minor injuries.\n\nRescue crews had to dismantle the wreckage to recover the vehicle. \n\nLocal reports are calling it a \"miracle of survival.\"\n\nThis is what happens when a car is engineered with safety as a priority, not an afterthought. \n\nTesla's rigid structural design and low center of gravity from the battery placement aren't just marketing points. \n\nThey're the reason this driver is alive.\n\n800 meters is over 2,600 feet. \n\nThat's not a fender bender. \n\nThat's falling off a mountain.\n\nMost vehicles would have become a coffin. \n\nThe Model Y became a survival pod.\n\nSource: @elonmusk / @ray4tesla",

        "text": "Stack Overflow 今年 7 月份发布的 2025 年度开发者调查（https://t.co/lQvwbbQ6ds ），这是他们连续第 15 年做这件事。来自 177 个国家的程序员填写了问卷，覆盖 314 种技术栈，今年还专门加了 AI Agent 和大模型相关的问题。如果说有什么能代表全球程序员的集体判断，大概就是这份报告了。\n\n今年的主题很明确：AI 到底改变了什么？\n\n早些年的时候，程序员们对 AI 的态度两级分化的很厉害，一部分相当狂热，觉得“AI 要替代程序员了”，一部分人敬而远之，觉得还是手搓代码更靠得住，其实都源自对 AI 的神秘感。\n\n从今年这份报告中，可以看得出，程序员们开始进入“AI 祛魅期”，AI 编程工具已经成为程序员日常不可或缺的一部分。但与此同时，用得越多，却反而越不放心。\n\n【1】AI 的“差不多对”困境\n\n如果你问开发者对 AI 工具最大的不满是什么，排名第一的答案可能出乎意料，不是“太笨”，不是“太慢”，而是“差不多对，但不完全对”。66% 的开发者选了这个选项。\n\n这比“完全错”更让人头疼。\n\n可能很多人都经历过这种场景：AI 给你生成了一段代码，看起来挺像那么回事，跑起来也没报错。但藏着一个微妙的逻辑漏洞，可能要到上线之后、在某个边界条件下才会暴露。你是信它还是不信？逐行 review 吧，费时间；不 review 吧，心里没底。\n\n这就是现在大多数开发者的日常。45% 的人说，debug AI 生成的代码比自己写的还耗时。\n\n两年前 ChatGPT 刚出来的时候，社交媒体上到处是“30 秒写个贪吃蛇”的演示视频，仿佛编程这件事即将被彻底颠覆。但真把 AI 带进日常工作流之后，大家发现了一个尴尬的现实：它更像一个过度自信的实习生，而不是什么超级智能。\n\n写代码很快，但你得盯着。偶尔有灵光，但经常犯低级错误。最要命的是，它永远一副胸有成竹的样子，从不说“我不确定”。\n\n这解释了为什么使用率和满意度出现了背离。大家不是不用，而是用了之后发现，省下写代码的时间，又花在了 review 代码上。生产力提升是有的，但没有想象中那么大。AI 从“魔杖”变成了“需要管理的工具”。\n\n调查里还有个数据很说明问题：46% 的开发者主动表示不信任 AI 的准确性，只有 33% 表示信任。换句话说，真正“高度信任”AI 输出的人只有 3%。绝大多数人的态度是：用 AI，但是要验证。\n\n有个有趣的现象：35% 的开发者说，他们访问 Stack Overflow 是为了解决 AI 相关的问题。AI 制造的问题，最后还是要靠人类社区来兜底。Stack Overflow 从“编程问答平台”开始变成一个“AI 输出验证平台”。",

It helps us minimize shipping slop.\n\nDevelopers who already invested in CI/CD, testing, documentation, and code review are having the most success with AI tools. These \"boring\" foundations are accelerators. They turn agents from chaos generators into productivity multipliers.\n\nThe real opportunity is learning to work at a different altitude. Instead of typing syntax, we're reviewing implementations, catching edge cases, and shipping features in hours that used to take days. That's genuinely exciting.\n\nYes, there's a learning curve. Understanding how to provide context, iterate on plans, and review AI-generated code quickly takes practice. But this is learnable through doing - build small tools, review everything, develop intuition through repetition.\n\nThe multiplier potential is real when you combine AI speed with engineering judgment. We're not replacing coding skills but we're finally able to focus them on the interesting problems while delegating the tedious parts.",

Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?\n\nGrok explanation is ~close:\n\n“Agency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It’s about being proactive rather than reactive—someone with high agency doesn’t just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one’s path.\n\nPeople with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They’re the type to say, “I’ll figure it out,” and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces—like luck, other people, or circumstances—to dictate what happens next.\n\nIt’s not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal—it’s the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them.”",

They are looking at how this technology can support their \"Citizen Bus\" project, which helps transport seniors who can no longer drive themselves.\n\nThis is huge. We often talk about FSD in big cities, but its impact on rural areas will be even bigger. It gives people their freedom back.\n\nAnd for those who think the system can't handle narrow European country roads, Andreas Kruppert had this to say:\n\n🇩🇪 \"Das Thema autonomes Fahren klingt für viele nach Zukunftsmusik und wir sehen einfach hier, dass es auch in der ländlichen Region total gut funktioniert.\" \n\n🇺🇸 \"Autonomous driving sounds like science fiction to many, but we simply see here that it works totally well in rural regions too.\"\n\nJohannes Kuhl was just as impressed with the driving quality:\n\n🇩🇪 \"Es fühlt sich an, als ob ein sehr geübter Fahrer fahren würde.\" \n\n🇺🇸 \"It feels like a very experienced driver is driving.\"\n\nThis is the future I am excited about. Technology that doesn't just look cool, but actually helps people live better lives 👏🏽",

Humans don’t.\n\nTheir data shows it could eliminate 30% to 44% of distracted driving crashes.\n\nIf these numbers hold up, not using it sounds way more dangerous than using it.\n\nSource: @Tesla  @SawyerMerritt",

      "text": "设计师该不该写代码？\n\n类似的话题隔几年就会火一次。最近随着 Cursor、v0 这些 AI 工具的成熟，用代码做设计变得前所未有地容易，于是这话题在设计圈又成了热门话题。\n\nLinear 的创始人 Karri Saarinen 最近写了一篇文章，他的观点让我挺有共鸣：这个问题本身就问错了。\n\n【1】问对问题\n\n最让我共鸣的其实是他思考问题的框架：\n> 我学会的第一件事就是：先质疑问题本身，而不是把它当作既定假设。如果有人让我做一个东西，我会先问：这是一个真问题吗？如果我们不做这个会怎样？是谁定义了这个问题？\n\n就像前几天我分享的自己的失败的 Agent 落地故事，就是问题没有定义清楚，错把重点放在如何构建 Agent 上，而不是我们的设计系统是要解决什么问题？Agent 能带来什么价值？\n\n还有日常工作中，项目拖延或失败，最常见的原因不是方案不好，而是大家脑子里想的根本不是同一个问题。\n> 人们在解决方案上无法达成一致，是因为他们脑子里想解决的问题根本就不一样。最终的方案变成了针对许多不同问题的妥协，而不是针对一个核心问题的漂亮解答。当利益相关者太多时，情况会变得更糟。\n\n你以为在讨论“怎么解决 A”，他以为在讨论“怎么解决 B”。方案当然对不上。最后的妥协版，变成了同时解决 A、B、C 三个问题的缝合怪，哪个都没解决好。\n\n职场上多少惨痛的教训都来源于没有问对问题。\n\n回到开头说的“设计师该不该写代码？”的问题，Karri 认为，争论这个问题太表面了。真正该问的是：“AI 时代，我们对设计师的期待会变成什么？”\n\n设计师会变成工程师吗？工程师会被期望承担设计职责吗？以后还会有“设计负责人”和“工程负责人”的区分，还是会合并成一个“产品工艺负责人”？\n\n这些问题归根结底问的是我们对“设计的价值”到底怎么理解。\n\n如果你觉得设计就是把按钮放到屏幕上，那用什么工具确实不重要，越快越好。\n\n但如果设计还包括别的东西：比如想清楚为什么要做这个功能、这个功能的整体形态应该是什么？那工具的选择就不只是效率问题了。\n\n这里有个微妙的问题：工具会塑造行为。\n\n当你打开 Figma，你会想着画界面；当你打开 VS Code，你会想着写逻辑。工具暗示了一个起点，而起点往往决定了你会跳过什么。如果代码成为设计的默认起点，那些“动手之前的思考”会不会被悄悄挤掉？\n\n那什么才是动手之前应该想清楚的？Karri 分享了他的一套方法。\n\n【2】Karri 的设计方法论\n\nKarri 不是科班出身，二十年实战自学成才。他之前在 Airbnb 做设计系统，后来创办了 Linear。他分享了自己做设计的一套方法，我觉得很有参考价值。\n\n简单说，他把设计分成三个阶段：问题、概念、执行。\n\n第一步是质疑问题本身。\n\n接到一个需求，他第一反应不是动手，而是问：这是真问题吗？如果不做会怎样？谁定义的这个问题？\n\n这听起来有点“杠精”，但他发现，设计项目拖延或失败，最常见的原因不是方案不好，而是大家对“到底要解决什么问题”没达成共识。每个人脑子里想的问题不一样，自然对方案有不同意见。最后做出来的东西，往往是各种问题的妥协，而不是一个问题的漂亮解法。\n\n他有个小技巧：给利益相关方展示方案时，先复述一遍你理解的问题。如果有人皱眉头或者提出异议，先停下来，把问题对齐了再继续。\n\n第二步是概念探索。\n\n问题想清楚了，接下来要想的是：这个东西的整体形态应该是什么？\n\n这一步很容易被跳过。很多人拿到需求就开始画界面、写代码，但 Karri 认为，在动手之前，应该先在更高的抽象层面想清楚几种可能的方向。\n\n他举了 Linear 做“项目”功能的例子。问题是明确的：公司需要用项目来组织工作。但项目在产品里可以有很多形态——它可以是一个大任务下面挂一堆子任务，可以是一个标签或文件夹，也可以是一个独立的实体。\n\n这几种形态，不需要写代码就能比较取舍。它们背后是不同的产品理念。Linear 团队认为项目是公司最重要的工作单元，产品围绕项目发布，团队围绕项目协作，所以项目应该是一个独立的、有自己“长相和性格”的东西，而不是降格成一个标签。\n\n这个决策发生在概念层面，是在写代码之前就想清楚的。\n\n第三步才是执行。\n\n把概念落地成真实可用的东西。这一步确实需要代码，需要和材料搏斗。但因为前面已经有了方向和信心，遇到细节问题时，你知道自己在往哪推。\n\nKarri 用了一个很妙的比喻：前两个阶段像是给 AI 写 prompt——你在构建目标、上下文和约束条件；执行阶段，是你引导 Agent 完成具体任务。prompt 写得好，输出才靠谱。\n\n用过 Claude 或者 ChatGPT 的人应该有体会。你给 AI 一个模糊的指令，比如“帮我写个文章”，它会给你一堆泛泛的东西。但如果你先花时间想清楚：这篇文章是给谁看的、要解决什么问题、有什么约束、想要什么风格——然后把这些写进 prompt 里，AI 的输出质量会好得多。\n\nKarri 说的“概念阶段”就是这个意思。你不是在画图，你是在建立一个清晰的“问题定义”：我们要解决什么、为什么这样解决、边界在哪里。这套东西，就是你后续所有工作的“prompt”。\n\n那“执行阶段引导 Agent”是什么意思？\n\n用过 AI 写代码或者写文章的人知道，AI 不是一次就能给你完美答案的。它会给你一个初稿，你看完说“这里不对，换个方向”，它再改；你又说“这个细节再深入一点”，它再调。整个过程是你在不断引导、纠偏、做判断。\n\n设计的执行阶段也是一样。你打开 Figma 或者编辑器开始做，做着做着发现这个交互不顺、那个布局太挤、这个概念用户理解不了。你得不断做决策：这里妥协一下，那里坚持原来的想法，这个地方干脆推翻重来。\n\n这个过程不是机械执行，而是持续的判断和引导。\n\n【3】Karri 真正担心的是什么\n\nKarri 说，他担心的不是代码，也不是工具。他担心的是“慢思考”的消亡。\n\n当工具让执行变得太容易，人们会跳过问题定义和概念探索，直接开干。迭代是快了，但迭代的方向可能从一开始就没想清楚。\n\n更麻烦的是，这会变成一种文化。当“直接用代码做设计”成为默认选项，当组织开始用“代码产出”来衡量设计师的贡献，那些花时间思考问题、探索概念的人，会显得很慢、很没效率。久而久之，没人愿意做那种“慢功夫”了。\n\n他的原话是：我们开始贬低设计背后的“为什么”，而只看重产出。\n\n最后的结果是什么？产品会越来越同质化。因为大家都在用差不多的工具、差不多的流程、差不多的节奏，在差不多的时间压力下做差不多的决策。那些独特的、深思熟虑的产品，会变得越来越稀少。\n\n【4】我的看法\n\nKarri 这套方法论，我觉得在很多场景下是对的，尤其是他做的那类产品——B2B 工具，用户需求相对清晰，产品需要长期打磨。\n\n但它也有边界。\n\n在 C 端消费产品、游戏、社交这些领域，用户动机很难预测，有时候“先做出来试试”反而是更高效的探索方式。快速原型、快速验证本身也是一种思考，只是形态不同。\n\nKarri 担忧的“用代码做设计会让人跳过慢思考”，问题不在于用什么工具，而在于人有没有思考的习惯和空间。\n\nAI 时代，执行会越来越快、越来越便宜。但“写 prompt”的能力——也就是定义问题、建立上下文、明确方向的能力反而会变得更值钱。因为 Agent 跑得再快，如果方向不对，也只是更快地跑偏。\n\nAI 时代需要的，可能不是“慢下来”，而是一种新能力：在更快的节奏中保持思考深度。你可以用 AI 快速生成十个方向，但你得有判断力选出对的那个。你可以用代码快速原型，但你得先想清楚要验证什么假设。\n\n工具变了，节奏变了，但“想清楚再动手”这件事的价值没变。\n\nKarri 文章最后写道：\n> 设计从来不是关于按钮是什么、放在哪。设计是找到对的问题、对的意图、对的愿景。你今天做的每个功能，都应该是迈向那个愿景的深思熟虑的一步。\n\n这话放在 AI 时代，依然成立。",

Dec 1st is a Sunday. Important holidays: Dec 25 (Christmas).\nPhase 2: Constructing Image Prompt\nAI generates internal prompt: A vintage Art Nouveau calendar page, aged paper texture.\nHeader: Ornamented text \"DECEMBER 2024\" interwoven with frosted pine branches.\nMain Illustration (Center): A cozy illustration of squirrels gathering nuts in a snowy hollow log.\nBorder: A dense, flowing border of oak leaves, acorns, roots, and sleeping woodland creatures framing the entire page.\nGrid: A 7-column grid below. Headers \"SUN MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT\" in decorative script. The number '1' is placed directly under 'SUN'. The grid fills sequentially to '31' under 'TUE'.\nHoliday Marking: The number '25' is encircled by a glowing wreath of holly berries and gold light, indicating Christmas.\nFillers: The empty slots after '31' are filled with small, stylized red acorn silhouettes. Color palette is muted earth tones, deep greens, and antique gold.",

The \"{Subject}\" seamlessly emerges from dense spark trails, glowing embers, and dazzling radiant bursts, with smooth, precise contours and vivid clarity. It blends naturally into the surrounding firework display, appearing as an integral part of the overall spectacle, visually vibrant and photorealistic.\nBehind and around the central \"{Subject}\", an expansive, celebratory firework show fills the night sky with layered radial explosions, cascading spark showers, and multi-stage bursts, creating impressive depth and dimension. Background fireworks maintain a slightly lower brightness to emphasize the central \"{Subject}\" sharply and distinctly.\nThe night sky is pure and deep navy-to-black, clear and cloudless with minimal haze or smoke. Firework colors include a sophisticated palette of gold, silver, white, red, and blue, demonstrating physically accurate light bloom, subtle glow effects, realistic particle dynamics, and natural variation in intensity and timing.\nFirework bursts softly illuminate the surrounding sky, producing gentle, cinematic-quality light falloff, capturing a realistic and immersive celebratory atmosphere.\nThe image is ultra-high-resolution, sharply detailed with photographic realism, and contains no additional text or extra visual elements—only the \"{Subject}\" displayed distinctly through fireworks.\n\nSubject: I 💗 U",

Since then, we’ve had\n• years of real world data collection\n• multiple hardware generations\n• vision only going against industry consensus of LiDAR\n• endless doubt and skepticism, delays, and “it’ll never work” headlines\n\nThis is nearly a decade of hard work and intelligent iterations to reach this moment.\n\nWhen the person with the most to lose is willing to trust the system with his own life, this debate now ends overnight. We’ve been waiting for this day for almost 10 years… \n\nElon may not always be on time, may be very optimistic at times, but he and his team always delivers. \n\nDamn, it feels good to be a retail Tesla investor.",

And I’ve realized more and more that the difference between Elon and most founders or CEOs is very simple and super rare.\n\nMany CEOs lead and give orders from an ivory tower, while Elon is always and willing to fight in the trenches with his people. While many CEOs give orders from a far, Elon is hands on with everything at Tesla. He’s on the factory floor. In the engineering and design room. In uncomfortable situations and makes the tough decisions. On top of this, he directly uses the products him and the team builds first hand and is wiling to put his heath and life at risk in doing so.\n\nI remember when he was willing to risk arrest during COVID rather than shut down what his team was fighting to build. He put his own freedom on the line because he believed in the mission and in the people behind it.\n\n“Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.” - Elon Musk\n\nThis kind of leadership is different.\n\nWhen your CEO is willing to take the hits for the team, sleep on the factory floor, and personally stand in front of the fire, it creates trust that he will NEVER let Tesla fail.\n\nReal leaders don’t hide, they step forward, as one.",

Extend it periodically to all the real line.\n\nAs Grok correctly notes, this is Takagi function (or blancmange curve), with a fractal-like graph. It is continuous, nowhere differentiable, and less well-known than the Weierstrass function.\n \nThis function also emerged recently (and independently) in a joint work https://t.co/pgJw9MaEA1  with my student, Natanael Alpay, as a sharp lower bound for the L^1 norm of the square function applied to indicator functions of sets. I was unaware at the time that it is known as the Takagi function or of its connection to the Riemann Hypothesis. Large language models will undoubtedly accelerate scientific discoveries by forging connections across diverse fields of science.",

A building-sized wink at Microsoft, visible from orbit, impossible to ignore.\n\nIt reads like a joke, until you look at what’s underneath.\n\n⚆ Colossus 2 isn’t a concept site or a slide in a deck. Power and cooling infrastructure are expanding in lockstep, with the campus pushing toward ~400 MW of active capacity in the near term. Gas turbines are arriving. Cooling towers are multiplying. The build is loud because the progress is real.\n\n⚆ More importantly, this early ramp sits on a much larger foundation. xAI has secured a clear path towards large scale on-site generation, creating a credible trajectory toward more than 2 GW of IT capacity over time. This isn’t aspirational: it’s ordered hardware, permitted infrastructure, and steel on the ground.\n\nThe subtext is clear: while others debate timelines, this campus is already running. The roof says MACROHARD. The infrastructure says we’re ahead.",

      "text": "Notion 的创始人 Ivan Zhao 的精彩文章：《钢铁、蒸汽机与无限大脑》\n\n越来越清晰的感觉到，我们正处于 AI 革命的早期阶段，对于未来谁也不知道会怎么样，所以都喜欢从历史中、去工业革命、互联网革命中寻找规律，以期望能对未来有所启发。\n\n相对来说，这篇文章虽然也是尝试从钢铁和蒸汽机的历史里，寻找 AI 时代的答案，还是挺有深度。\n\n【1】第一个观点是：我们正在看着后视镜开车\n\n每一代新技术刚出来时，人们总是习惯用旧的方式去理解它。这就是所谓的“看着后视镜驶向未来”。\n\n想想看，早期的电话，大家把它当成“会说话的电报\"；早期的电影，其实就是把摄像机架在观众席拍舞台剧。\n\n现在的 AI 也是一样。我们看到的 AI 大多长什么样？一个聊天框。为什么？因为它在模仿 Google 搜索框。\n\n我们正处在这个尴尬的过渡期。就像当年大家还不懂电影剪辑语言一样，我们现在还在试图把 AI 硬塞进旧的工作模式里。\n\n【2】个人层面：从骑自行车到开汽车\n\n乔布斯当年有个著名的比喻，说电脑是“大脑的自行车\"。意思是它能让人跑得更快，但你还得自己蹬。\n\n对于现在的程序员来说，AI 已经不是自行车了，而是汽车。你不用蹬了，你只需要握好方向盘。\n\nIvan 讲了他的联合创始人 Simon 的故事。\n\nSimon 以前是传说中的“10 倍工程师\"，但现在几乎不自己写代码了。路过他工位，你会看到他像指挥官一样同时调度三四个 AI 编程智能体。这些 AI 不只打字快，还能思考。他在吃饭或睡前把任务排好队，AI 就在后台疯狂干活。\n\n他从“写代码的人\"，变成了“管理无限大脑的人\"。\n\n【3】为什么只有程序员先享受到了从骑自行车到开汽车的待遇？\n\n但问题来了，为什么只有程序员先享受到了这种待遇？普通的文案、运营、产品经理为什么还在“蹬自行车\"？\n\n两个原因：\n\n第一，上下文太碎了。程序员的代码都在仓库里，环境单纯。\n但普通人的工作散落在 Slack、飞书、文档、甚至脑子里。AI 不知道前因后果，没法干活。\n\n第二，没法验证。代码写错了会报错，好坏一目了然。\n但一个活动策划案好不好？一份周报写得对不对？这很难量化。\n\n所以，想要从自行车升级到汽车，我们得先帮 AI 把上下文补齐，并且找到验证工作成果的方法。\n\n【4】组织层面：不仅是换引擎，还要换地基\n\n个人层面说完，Ivan 把视角拉到组织层面，用了“钢铁\"和“蒸汽机\"两个比喻，来解释 AI 会如何重塑公司。\n\n第一个是钢铁。\n\n在钢铁普及之前，房子盖不高。因为用砖头和木头，盖到六七层，底下的墙就被压垮了。这就像现在的公司，人数一过几百，沟通成本就爆炸了，效率急剧下降。人与人之间的沟通，就是那个脆弱的“砖墙\"。\n\nAI 就是组织的“钢铁\"。它能支撑起巨大的信息流，让决策不需要层层汇报就能完成。未来的公司，可能几千人规模还能像创业团队一样敏捷，因为 AI 撑住了沟通的架构。\n\n第二个是蒸汽机。\n\n最早的工厂都建在河边，因为要用水车做动力。蒸汽机刚发明时，很多老板只是把水车拆了，换成蒸汽机，但工厂还在河边，流程也没变。效率提升非常有限。\n\n直到后来，老板们意识到：\n“等一下，既然不用水了，我为什么不把工厂搬到离港口更近的地方？\"\n\n工厂可以建在离工人、港口、原材料更近的地方。整个车间可以围绕蒸汽机重新设计。后来电力普及，工厂进一步把集中的动力轴拆散，给每台机器配上独立的电机。生产力才真正爆发，第二次工业革命才真正起飞。\n\n我们现在还在“换水车\"阶段。AI 聊天机器人挂在现有工具上，工作流程还是为人设计的。我们还没认真想过：如果旧的约束消失了，组织应该长什么样？\n\n真正的变革，是当管理者意识到可以彻底重组工作流，让那些“不睡觉的大脑\"去处理所有重复性工作的时候。\n\nNotion 自己就在做实验。他们 1000 人的公司里，活跃着 700 多个 AI Agent。这些 AI 负责写会议纪要、回答内部咨询、处理 IT 请求、写周报。这不仅仅是省时间，这是在重塑组织形态。\n\n回看你的工作，如果只是用 ChatGPT 润色邮件，那你就是在把水车换成蒸汽机，工厂还在河边。试着想一想：如果我有无限个免费实习生（AI），工作流程应该怎么彻底重设计？\n\n【5】经济层面：从佛罗伦萨到东京\n\n最后 Ivan 把视角再拉高一层：钢铁和蒸汽不只改变了建筑和工厂，还改变了城市。\n\n几百年前，城市是人类尺度的。佛罗伦萨走个四十分钟就能穿城而过，生活节奏由人能走多远、声音能传多响决定。然后钢铁框架让摩天楼成为可能，蒸汽铁路把市中心和腹地连起来，电梯、地铁、高速公路跟上。城市在规模和密度上爆发了。东京、重庆、达拉斯，这些不是“更大版本的佛罗伦萨\"，而是完全不同的生存方式——更混乱、更匿名、更难辨认方向，但也提供了更多机会和自由。\n\nIvan 认为知识经济正站在同样的转折点上。今天的知识工作占了美国 GDP 的近一半，但大部分还是人类尺度的运作：几十人的团队，会议和邮件定义的节奏，超过几百人就开始失灵的组织。我们用石头和木头建造了很多佛罗伦萨。\n\n当 AI 智能体大规模上线，我们会开始建造东京。成千上万的智能体和人类协作，工作流程全天候运转不等人醒来，决策在恰到好处的人类参与下被综合。周会、季度规划、年度考核的节奏可能不再合理，新的节奏会涌现。\n\n我们将失去一些“小而美\"的清晰感，但会换来前所未有的规模和速度。\n\nIvan 提到一个历史趣事：1865 年英国有个《红旗法案》，规定汽车上路时必须有人举着红旗走在前面开路。听起来荒谬，但我们现在要求 AI 每做一步都要人确认，是不是也像“举红旗\"？真正的未来，是人站在更高处监管，而不是挡在路中间。\n\n也许我们应该停止从后视镜看世界，开始想象新的可能。卡内基看着钢铁，看到了城市天际线。兰开夏郡的工厂主看着蒸汽机，看到了不再依赖河流的车间。\n\n我们还在问 AI 怎么当好“副驾驶\"。也许该问的是：当无限心智成为基础设施，知识工作会变成什么样？\n\n这个问题，Ivan 没给答案。但他给了一个思考的框架。对于正在这场变革中的人来说，框架可能比答案更有用。",

A building-sized wink at Microsoft, visible from orbit, impossible to ignore.\n\nIt reads like a joke, until you look at what’s underneath.\n\n⚆ Colossus 2 isn’t a concept site or a slide in a deck. Power and cooling infrastructure are expanding in lockstep, with the campus pushing toward ~400 MW of active capacity in the near term. Gas turbines are arriving. Cooling towers are multiplying. The build is loud because the progress is real.\n\n⚆ More importantly, this early ramp sits on a much larger foundation. xAI has secured a clear path towards large scale on-site generation, creating a credible trajectory toward more than 2 GW of IT capacity over time. This isn’t aspirational: it’s ordered hardware, permitted infrastructure, and steel on the ground.\n\nThe subtext is clear: while others debate timelines, this campus is already running.

Elon Musk's companies deliver between $100b to $140b of taxes and added value to the US and it's citizens every year (more than the GDP of a small state), and these contributions are growing faster than the US economy every year.\n3. To spell it out to the unbelievers, the US (and particularly Elon's 140,000 employees) is earning an enormous return from Elon Musk's wealth.",

They all repeat the claim that his company has received benefits of $38b from the US Government.  \nLet's look at his REAL economic impact to the U.S. It's mind blowing.\nMusk’s ventures currently contribute $100–140B in annual GDP impact, or roughly 0.4% of total U.S. GDP. And growing faster – considerably faster – than the US economy, promising even greater contributions in the future.\nThat’s more annual contribution to US GDP than entire annual GDP of smaller U.S. states, like West Virginia (~$108 billion, 0.37%) or Hawaii (~$116 billion, 0.40%). And growing faster.\nOn top of that NASA and US Department of War have cumulatively saved over $40 billion as a direct result of SpaceX delivering a reduction in the cost of delivery of launch and communication services over traditional vendors. SO much for Musk Companies having \"received\" $38b. In other words, had the U.S. not paid Musk companies $38b, then the US would have had to spend $78b with competitors (and possibly then not received a delivery of the goods ordered! Boeing, looking at you.) Not to mention that Starlink practically saved Ukraine from being overrun in the early days of the Russian invasion.\nSeems we are all, all Americans - and citizens of the world in fact - benefiting from the growth of Musk’s net worth. Here are the numbers:\nPlease post this in response to every post you see bleating about Musk being a billionaire or trillionaire and how its so terrible.",

You do it, then life is immediately better for every citizen.\n\nIf your answer is it's morally wrong because of individual rights, then believe me, being in a fully funded institution is far, far better for someone than living on the streets in their own filth, tortured by their inner mental demons, and in constant anguish over who knows what.\n\nTheir own families (when they can be found) want this for them as well. That's often why they are out on the streets—because they became too much for their parents/grandparents/brothers/sisters to deal with. \n\nYou're doing nobody any favors, nobody, by letting these people roam the streets in anguish, creating even more anguish.",

Mark Kelly a \"Traitor\" for pushing to send more U.S. aid and weapons to Ukraine.\n\nHe’s calling out what he sees as moral theater around the war, arguing that thousands keep dying in trenches with “no movement in the lines” and no realistic path to stopping it.\n\nIt’s an uncomfortable take, but it cuts through slogans and forces the question many avoid: if there’s no plan to end it, what exactly are all these lives being lost for?\n\n“We should have empathy for the thousands of people dying everyday in the trenches, for no movement in the lines, for the past two years thousands of people have died every week for nothing.\n\nI take great offense at those who put the appearance of goodness over the reality of it. \n\nThose who virtue signal and say we can't give into Russia, but have no solution to stopping thousands of kids dying every day.\n\nI have contempt for such people and I want to make that clear, because they're virtue signaling and their lack of a solution means that kids don't have a father… It means parents lost a son. \n\nFor what? Nothing.\"\n\nSource: @elonmusk, Fox News",

Extremely refined, excellent lane choices and some parking improvements are a few things to note. \n\nReally stoked about the lane changes on this build. There is ZERO lane indecisiveness, no hesitation, no stuttering. Nothing. I had never really seen much before, but this build you can tell its decision making process is much quicker and it commits. \n\nMad Max mode is definitely mad again and I love it. Seems even quicker than v14.2.1.25 which was an improvement, but the lane changes + choices are better now. Hurry mode seems quicker on the highways and larger roads than before and very close to Mad Max, it was perfect before on v14.2.1.25. \n\nThe new addition on the release notes for arrival pin being adjusted based on arrival option works. It changes the route based on if you’re going curbside, or to the lot or street parking. It behaved that way before usually but now it’s visualized. \n\nParking is improved and impressive this build. Every single spot I parked in, it performed excellent. Centered in the lines, quick one and done parking jobs and they were great, improvement over early v14.2 builds. In parking garages, it now pulls up exactly at the ticket dispenser where in earlier v14.2 builds it would stop 9 inches short like I mentioned in previous v14.2+ build reviews. That’s fixed and worked great- couldn’t have asked for it to be any better. Perfect distance and approach- will do a lot more of this testing tomorrow. \n\nCanyon roads were insanely impressive. Did the snake 3 times which is a super narrow and twisty road and each time it performed great. Speeds were good, took the proper lines and even accelerated out of corners very well. These were all in the dark too very late at night- will post some more videos of it. \n\nStop and go traffic performance in rush hour was awesome as before, with some added notes for how well it waited to enter an intersection if there was stopped traffic on the other side. It waited 3/3 lights I encountered where if it went and the light changed, it would be sticking into traffic so it didn’t go. Exactly like a human wouldn’t but the car judged it better than I did. One time it creeped a bit slow, but other than that fine since. Saw one instance of red hands but before I could react, it had already recovered itself. \n\nStill so impressed with how well it handles lane splitting motorcycles. It sees them approaching before I even do, and moves over just enough to be courteous to the rider as well as the car or shoulder next to me. Nice touch, and glad to see it perform well. \n\nOne thing I noticed is how smooth its steering inputs always are. It just takes corners with such precision and smoothness that no human could ever come close to it. Especially noticeable on twisty roads- it drives better than almost every human on them. And I encountered a power outage tonight and the car still drove perfectly even with pitch black around. \n\nOverall, loving what I’m seeing with this build. Will report back in the day time with more but I am going to head home to get some sleep. \n\nAnother huge thank you to all the magicians @Tesla_AI for working so hard during the holiday season to get these updates out.",

The past decade was an outright operation to discriminate against Whites through left wing policy, and now they’re trying to pretend it was a few woke scolds on Twitter. It wasn’t and we will never let this lie take root. I say all of this as a Latino who had actual privilege by being a minority during that time period. If I can recognize this then surely you should be able to. \n\nIt can never happen again and the people who were responsible should never see an ounce of power again. Not even as a dogcatcher.

They all repeat the claim that his company has received benefits of $38b from the US Government.  \nLet's look at his REAL economic impact to the U.S. It's mind blowing.\nMusk’s ventures currently contribute $100–140B in annual GDP impact, or roughly 0.4% of total U.S. GDP. And growing faster – considerably faster – than the US economy, promising even greater contributions in the future.\nThat’s more annual contribution to US GDP than entire annual GDP of smaller U.S. states, like West Virginia (~$108 billion, 0.37%) or Hawaii (~$116 billion, 0.40%). And growing faster.\nOn top of that NASA and US Department of War have cumulatively saved over $40 billion as a direct result of SpaceX delivering a reduction in the cost of delivery of launch and communication services over traditional vendors. SO much for Musk Companies having \"received\" $38b. In other words, had the U.S. not paid Musk companies $38b, then the US would have had to spend $78b with competitors (and possibly then not received a delivery of the goods ordered! Boeing, looking at you.) Not to mention that Starlink practically saved Ukraine from being overrun in the early days of the Russian invasion.\nSeems we are all, all Americans - and citizens of the world in fact - benefiting from the growth of Musk’s net worth. Here are the numbers:\nPlease post this in response to every post you see bleating about Musk being a billionaire or trillionaire and how its so terrible.",
