        "text": "🧵 Who organized and funded the pro-Maduro demonstrations?\n\nI was up when the news broke that U.S. forces had possibly had a military strike on Caracas. Immediately, I knew where to look next, not for confirmation from the Pentagon, but for signals.\n\n🔗 READ my 1st story for @FoxNews in my new role as senior editor of investigations to understand the full narrative of how the street protests were organized within 12 hours, before Nicolás Maduro was even on U.S. soil: https://t.co/t5tSwhVR7s\n\n📽️ WATCH the video here to hear the protest organizers in their own words as they chronicle how they mobilized foot soldiers for the new \"class war\" they say they are fighting against \"American imperialism.\" They admit they got an unexpected ally: Democratic Party activists in 50501, a group launched last year to organize #TeslaTakedown protests against Elon Musk and #HandsOff protests against Trump.\n\nWhat I discovered:\nAs U.S. forces captured Maduro, a parallel operation began almost instantly inside the United States:a rapid, coordinated information and street-mobilization campaign by a network of self-described socialist, Marxist, and communist organizations, most of which operate as nonprofits that DO NOT have to pay taxes.\n\nI'll lay out how I followed the breadcrumbs in this special X Reporter's Notebook...\n\nFor three years since Oct. 7, I’d been seeing the same thing at protest after protest: Venezuelan flags showing up at anti-Israel rallies. Not randomly. Not organically.\n\nAlways alongside the same slogans, the same organizers, the same faces. That’s when I knew this wasn’t about Gaza, or Venezuela, or “peace.”\n\n🔻 When activists protested Benjamin Netanyahu and burnt the American flag and painted an upside red triangle using the symbol Hamas uses for targets, writing HAMAS IS COMIN, I went to their bus pickup spots to follow the money. I saw protestors climbing into busses. That's when I saw their t-shirts: they were all proudly wearing red t-shirts for the Party for Socialism and Liberation @pslnational. The group had rented the busses.\n\nThen I went to the address for the @answercoalition that had gotten the protest permit. It was in Adam's Morgan on Florida Avenue NW not far from where I had lived as a 20-something in DC.\n\nOutside there were two flags flapping in the wind. Whose flags are they, I asked the woman who answered the door.\n\n\"Cuba and Venezuela.\"\n\nThat's when I knew. This wasn't about peace or anti-war.\n\nIt was about ideology.\n\nStoking discord was a part of that ideology as a tactic called agitation propaganda, or agitprop.\n\nTheir goal was to overthrowthe \"American empire\" and install some version of a Marxist, communist or socialist system. Talk about regime change.\n\nAnd I learned something else: they had very close ties to Iran, Russia and China, with its leaders taking regular trips to those countries. They wanted communism or socialism in South Korea, the Philippines, Puerto Rico....America.\n\nI saw them again in Chicago, protesting the @DNC. We had cells of proud communists, socialists and Marxists in America and they were appropriating the latest cause of the day to press their cause to dismantle \"American imperialism.\"\n\nThey were self-declared, self-professed and proud of their ideological beliefs but the media usually glossed over them to describe them generically as \"demonstrators.\"\n\nSo when we learned that there was an air strike on Caracas, I watched the clock -- and waited for the signals.\n\n⏱️ 1:35 AM — As U.S. special operations reportedly land in Venezuela, @BTNews, a socialist propaganda arm of the ANSWER Coalition, posts early video and frames the mission as an “illegal bombing of Caracas.” The narrative is set.\n\n⏱️ 1:45 AM — Manolo De Los Santos @manolo_realengo of @PeoplesForumNYC echoes the “illegal bombing” line. Message discipline is established. The People's Forum had been funded by a tech tycoon named Neville Roy Singham, who lived in Shanghai and funded a global network of socialist causes.\n\n⏱️ 2:29 AM — The ANSWER Coalition drops a red-siren graphic on X calling for protests in Times Square: “NO WAR ON VENEZUELA.” The shift from commentary to mobilization begins.\n\n⏱️ 2:34–2:43 AM — The People’s Forum and the Party for Socialism and Liberation amplify the call. Same poster. Same language. Same timing.\n\n⏱️ 3:21 AM — @VijayPrashad, director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research, a research institute funded by Singham that examines issues through the lens of \"national liberation Marxism,\" weighs in with a tweet: “Down with U.S. imperialism.” The ideological framing goes global.\n\n⏱️ 6:09 AM — @CodePink condemns the U.S. as “terrorist.” The group was cofounded by Singham's wife, Jodie Evans, a fixture in anti-American protests, along with cofounder @medeabenjamin. Professional CodePink protestor @OliviaDinucci frequently yells at Trump administration officials around town. The nonprofit ecosystem is now fully engaged.\n\n⏱️ 7:49 AM — The International People’s Assembly @peoplesassembly, a global umbrella group for socialist and communist organizations that partners with Singham's Tricontinental institute, circulates an “EMERGENCY DAY OF ACTION,” urging resistance to U.S. “hegemony.” The command-and-control layer activates.\n\nThis wasn’t outrage catching fire.\n\nThis was a socialist, communist, Marxist transnational network executing information warfare with military precision.\n\nBy daylight, the narrative was locked.\n\nBy midday, the protests were live.\n\nBy afternoon, politicians like @RepRashida Talib, Rep. @AOC and @NYCMayor @ZohranKMamdani were repeating the same lines I’d seen first pushed in the dead of night.\n\nI’d seen the signals broadcast for years. Thorough investigators like @DataRepublican and @thestustustudio have followed the breadcrumbs on this vast network seeking to dismantle the U.S. free enterprise system in the name of \"anti-imperialism,\" and I encourage you to follow them to see well-documented information.\n\nFriday night, they came in strong and precise, in a parallel military operation run by comrades in the cause to destroy America as we know it.\n\nThis wasn’t just about Venezuela. It was about a global war -- an information war running parallel to a kinetic one -- and what I learned next was that it had been years in the making. 🧵⬇️",

File 方式：项目根目录新建 `.copilot-commit-message-instructions.md`，写入相同提示词（多项目复用更方便）\n\n推荐提示词：\n```md\n<!-- Text 方式 -->\n严格遵循 Conventional Commits 规范。格式：<type>(<scope>): <subject>。type 必须是：feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert 之一。subject 简洁明了，不超过50字符，首字母小写，不加句号。如有破坏性变更，必须在 body 中以 BREAKING CHANGE: 开头说明\n\n<!-- File 方式 -->\n# Git 提交消息规范\n\n本项目遵循 [Conventional Commits](https://t.co/8XYSWznVDk) 规范。\n\n## 提交消息格式\n\n```\n<type>(<scope>): <subject>\n\n<body>\n\n<footer>\n```\n\n### 必需部分\n\n#### Type (类型)\n\n提交的类型必须是以下之一：\n\n- **feat**: 新功能 (feature)\n- **fix**: 修复 bug\n- **docs**: 仅文档更改\n- **style**: 不影响代码含义的更改（空格、格式化、缺少分号等）\n- **refactor**: 既不修复 bug 也不添加功能的代码更改\n- **perf**: 提高性能的代码更改\n- **test**: 添加缺失的测试或更正现有测试\n- **build**: 影响构建系统或外部依赖的更改（示例范围：webpack, npm, vite）\n- **ci**: 对 CI 配置文件和脚本的更改（示例范围：GitHub Actions, GitLab CI）\n- **chore**: 其他不修改 src 或测试文件的更改\n- **revert**: 回退之前的提交\n\n#### Subject (主题)\n\n- 使用简洁的语言描述本次提交的更改\n- 不超过 50 个字符\n- 使用中文或英文（保持项目一致）\n- 首字母小写\n- 结尾不加句号\n\n### 可选部分\n\n#### Scope (范围)\n\n用于说明提交影响的范围，例如：\n\n- **component**: 组件相关\n- **api**: API 相关\n- **router**: 路由相关\n- **store**: 状态管理相关\n- **utils**: 工具函数相关\n- **styles**: 样式相关\n- **deps**: 依赖项相关\n\n#### Body (正文)\n\n- 详细描述本次提交的动机和更改内容\n- 可以分多行\n- 应该说明\"是什么\"和\"为什么\"，而不是\"怎么做\"\n\n#### Footer (页脚)\n\n- 用于关闭 Issue 或描述破坏性变更\n- Breaking Changes 必须在页脚中以 `BREAKING CHANGE:` 开头\n- 关闭 Issue 使用 `Closes #issue号`\n\n## 示例\n\n### 简单的功能添加\n\n```\nfeat(article): 添加文章搜索功能\n```\n\n### 修复 bug\n\n```\nfix(login): 修复登录状态未持久化的问题\n```\n\n### 包含详细描述\n\n```\nfeat(editor): 支持 Markdown 实时预览\n\n添加了一个新的编辑器组件，支持 Markdown 的实时预览功能。\n用户在编辑时可以同时看到渲染后的效果，提升编辑体验。\n\nCloses #123\n```\n\n### 破坏性变更\n\n```\nfeat(api): 重构用户认证 API\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: 用户认证接口从 /api/auth 迁移到 /api/v2/auth，\n旧接口将在下一个版本中移除。客户端需要更新 API 端点。\n```\n\n### 多个类型的示例\n\n```\nrefactor(utils): 优化文件上传工具函数\n```\n\n```\nperf(article): 优化文章列表渲染性能\n```\n\n```\ndocs(readme): 更新项目安装文档\n```\n\n```\nstyle(component): 统一组件代码格式\n```\n\n```\ntest(api): 添加文章 API 单元测试\n```\n\n```\nbuild(deps): 升级 Vue 到 3.4.0\n```\n\n```\nci: 添加自动部署流程\n```\n\n```\nchore: 更新 .gitignore 配置\n```\n\n## 注意事项\n\n1. **每次提交只做一件事**：如果一次更改涉及多个不相关的修改，应该拆分成多个提交\n2. **提交信息要清晰**：让其他开发者能够快速理解这次提交的目的\n3. **遵循团队约定**：如果团队有特殊的提交规范，以团队约定为准\n4. **及时提交**：完成一个功能点或修复一个问题后立即提交，不要积累太多更改\n5. **使用中文或英文**：保持项目提交消息语言的一致性\n\n## 工具支持\n\n推荐使用以下工具来辅助编写符合规范的提交消息：\n\n- **Commitizen**: 交互式提交工具\n- **commitlint**: 提交消息校验工具\n- **husky**: Git hooks 工具，配合 commitlint 使用\n\n## 参考资源\n\n- [Conventional Commits 官方文档](https://t.co/8XYSWznVDk)\n- [Angular 提交规范](https://t.co/Ubx0gDqMBw)\n```\n\n效率起飞，强烈安利！",

        "text": "AI 时代的代码审核：写两遍，反而更快\n\n做过几年开发的人，大概都有过这种痛苦记忆：第一版代码写完，功能好不容易跑通了，然后发现需求理解错了一半，技术方案踩了三个坑，架构设计根本撑不住后续迭代。\n\n想推翻重写？老板说deadline不等人。只好硬着头皮往上堆，三年后回头看，那坨代码已经成了没人敢动的屎山。\n\n这个问题存在了几十年，但现在 AI 编程工具的出现，意外地给了一个新解法。\n\n【1】我的解法：两个版本，两套标准\n\n这个解法其实不新，软件工程教科书里叫“原型开发法”：先做个粗糙版本验证想法，再正式开发。但以前没人这么干，因为成本太高。写一个能跑的原型，可能要花正式开发一半的时间，谁等得起？\n\n现在情况变了。AI 写代码的速度，快到让人不适应。以前一个功能要写三天，现在可能三小时就能出个能跑的版本。这个速度变化，让原型开发法从“理论上可行”变成了“实践中划算”。\n\n具体怎么做？分两个版本开发。\n\n【2】第一版：原型版，让AI撒欢跑\n\n第一个版本的定位很明确：原型，不是产品。目标只有两个：确认需求，解决技术难点。\n\n这个阶段的原则是“不管不顾”：不考虑架构设计，不考虑代码质量，不考虑安全性能。\n\n只考虑一件事：把功能实现出来。代码生成出来直接合并，不做 review，让 AI 反复迭代，直到产品经理点头说“对，这就是我要的”。\n\n这个版本的代码是准备扔掉的，所以要单独开个分支，或者干脆放在独立的仓库里。它的价值不在于代码本身，而在于两件事：确认需求到底是什么，以及把技术上的坑先踩一遍。\n\n很多时候，需求文档写得再详细，你不做出来就是想不清楚。技术难点也是，纸上谈兵和真刀真枪完全两回事。第一版的意义就在于此：用最低的成本，把该踩的坑踩完。\n\n就像建筑师画草图。草图不讲究线条精准、比例完美，它的作用是帮你把想法快速具象化，试错、调整、确认方向。没人会拿草图去施工。\n\n【3】第二版：生产版，回归传统工程\n\n等第一版把路探清楚了，再来做第二版。第二个版本才是真正要交付的东西。\n\n这个阶段回归传统软件工程的套路：先做设计，再拆模块，走 CI 流程，做 Code Review。每次提交的代码量要小，方便人工审核。设计、维护、安全，该考虑的都要考虑。\n\n在这个阶段，AI仍然是主力干活的，但人来主导。先设计后实现，配合plan模式，让AI按你的思路来生成代码。\n\n第一版的代码也不是完全白写，有些模块是可以复用的，尤其是算法实现和业务逻辑这些核心部分。\n\n相当于从草图里把有价值的部分提炼出来，放进正式的施工图。\n\n【4】这套方法有效的底层逻辑\n\n为什么要这么麻烦，搞两个版本？\n\n核心原因是：在第一版做完之前，你对需求的理解大概率是不完整的。\n\n传统开发模式的问题，恰恰在于它在第一版上花了太多精力。需求还没完全想清楚，就开始做架构设计；技术难点还没摸透，就开始考虑扩展性、可维护性。结果呢？大量过度设计，考虑了很多“未来可能会有但其实永远不会出现”的情况。时间花在了细枝末节上，真正重要的问题反而被忽略了。\n\n两版本开发法的好处是，让你先用最低成本把路趟一遍。第一版跑完，需求确认了，技术难点解决了，再来做设计，这时候你知道该设计什么、不该设计什么。少走很多弯路。\n\n还有一个隐藏好处。很多资深开发者不愿意用 AI 编程，核心原因是接受不了 AI 生成代码的质量。但如果你告诉他，这些代码就是用来扔的，只是为了验证想法，心理上的抵触就会小很多。这等于给了一个台阶：用 AI，但不用对那些代码负责。\n\n说到底，AI 改变的不只是写代码的速度，更是整个开发流程的经济学。以前做两遍太贵，现在做两遍反而更划算。承认第一版是用来扔的，反而能做出更好的第二版。",

        "text": "Code Review in the AI Era: Why Writing It Twice Is Actually Faster\n\nIf you've been coding for a few years, you've probably lived through this nightmare: you finish the first version, finally get it running, and then realize you misunderstood half the requirements, hit three technical dead ends, and the architecture won't survive the next iteration. Want to rewrite from scratch? The deadline says no. So you keep piling on patches, and three years later, that codebase has become the legacy monster no one dares to touch.\n\nThis problem has existed for decades. But AI coding tools have accidentally given us a new solution.\n\nMy Approach: Two Versions, Two Standards\n\nThis idea isn't new. Software engineering textbooks call it \"prototyping\", build a rough version to validate your ideas, then do the real development. But nobody actually did this, because it was too expensive. Building a working prototype could take half the time of the real implementation. Who has that kind of runway?\n\nThings have changed. AI writes code at a speed that still catches me off guard. A feature that used to take three days might now have a working version in three hours. This shift in velocity turns prototyping from \"theoretically nice\" into \"practically worth it.\"\n\nHere's how it works: you build two separate versions.\n\nVersion One: The Prototype, Let AI Run Wild\n\nThe first version has a clear purpose: it's a prototype, not a product. Two goals only: confirm the requirements and solve the hard technical problems.\n\nThe principle here is \"no constraints\", don't think about architecture, don't worry about code quality, ignore security and performance. Focus on one thing: make it work. Merge AI-generated code without review. Let the AI iterate until your product manager nods and says, \"Yes, that's what I wanted.\"\n\nThis code is meant to be thrown away, so put it on a separate branch or even in a standalone repo. Its value isn't in the code itself, it's in two things: figuring out what the requirements actually are, and stepping on all the technical landmines first.\n\nNo matter how detailed your requirements doc is, you often can't think clearly until you build something. Technical challenges are the same, theory and reality are different beasts. The first version exists to step on every landmine at the lowest possible cost.\n\nThink of it like an architect's sketch. Sketches don't need precise lines or perfect proportions. They help you externalize your thinking quickly, experiment, adjust, confirm direction. Nobody builds from a sketch.\n\nVersion Two: Production, Back to Traditional Engineering\n\nOnce the first version has cleared the path, you build the second. This is what actually ships.\n\nNow you return to traditional software engineering: design first, then break it into modules, run CI pipelines, do proper code reviews. Keep commits small so humans can actually review them. Consider design, maintainability, security, all the things that matter.\n\nAI still does the heavy lifting in this phase, but humans lead. Design before implementation. Use plan mode to have AI generate code according to your thinking.\n\nThe first version's code isn't completely wasted, some modules can be reused, especially algorithm implementations and core business logic.\n\nIt's like extracting the valuable parts from a sketch and putting them into proper construction drawings.\n\nWhy This Actually Works\n\nWhy go through the trouble of two versions?\n\nThe core reason: before the first version is done, your understanding of the requirements is almost certainly incomplete.\n\nThe problem with traditional development is that it invests too much effort in the first version. You start architecting before the requirements are fully understood. You consider scalability and maintainability before you've figured out the technical challenges. The result? Massive over-engineering for scenarios that \"might happen someday\" but never will. Time gets spent on edge cases while the real problems get ignored.\n\nThe two-version approach lets you clear the path at minimum cost first. After the first version, requirements are confirmed, technical problems are solved, and then you design—knowing exactly what to design and what to skip. Far fewer wrong turns.\n\nThere's a hidden benefit too. Many senior developers resist AI coding because they can't accept the quality of AI-generated code. But if you tell them this code is meant to be thrown away, it's just for validating ideas, the psychological resistance drops significantly. It's an out: use AI, but don't be responsible for that code.\n\nUltimately, AI hasn't just changed how fast we write code, it's changed the economics of the entire development process. Two passes used to be too expensive. Now two passes is actually cheaper. Accepting that the first version is disposable lets you build a much better second version.",

      "text": "AI 时代的代码审核：写两遍，反而更快\n\n做过几年开发的人，大概都有过这种痛苦记忆：第一版代码写完，功能好不容易跑通了，然后发现需求理解错了一半，技术方案踩了三个坑，架构设计根本撑不住后续迭代。\n\n想推翻重写？老板说deadline不等人。只好硬着头皮往上堆，三年后回头看，那坨代码已经成了没人敢动的屎山。\n\n这个问题存在了几十年，但现在 AI 编程工具的出现，意外地给了一个新解法。\n\n【1】我的解法：两个版本，两套标准\n\n这个解法其实不新，软件工程教科书里叫“原型开发法”：先做个粗糙版本验证想法，再正式开发。但以前没人这么干，因为成本太高。写一个能跑的原型，可能要花正式开发一半的时间，谁等得起？\n\n现在情况变了。AI 写代码的速度，快到让人不适应。以前一个功能要写三天，现在可能三小时就能出个能跑的版本。这个速度变化，让原型开发法从“理论上可行”变成了“实践中划算”。\n\n具体怎么做？分两个版本开发。\n\n【2】第一版：原型版，让AI撒欢跑\n\n第一个版本的定位很明确：原型，不是产品。目标只有两个：确认需求，解决技术难点。\n\n这个阶段的原则是“不管不顾”：不考虑架构设计，不考虑代码质量，不考虑安全性能。\n\n只考虑一件事：把功能实现出来。代码生成出来直接合并，不做 review，让 AI 反复迭代，直到产品经理点头说“对，这就是我要的”。\n\n这个版本的代码是准备扔掉的，所以要单独开个分支，或者干脆放在独立的仓库里。它的价值不在于代码本身，而在于两件事：确认需求到底是什么，以及把技术上的坑先踩一遍。\n\n很多时候，需求文档写得再详细，你不做出来就是想不清楚。技术难点也是，纸上谈兵和真刀真枪完全两回事。第一版的意义就在于此：用最低的成本，把该踩的坑踩完。\n\n就像建筑师画草图。草图不讲究线条精准、比例完美，它的作用是帮你把想法快速具象化，试错、调整、确认方向。没人会拿草图去施工。\n\n【3】第二版：生产版，回归传统工程\n\n等第一版把路探清楚了，再来做第二版。第二个版本才是真正要交付的东西。\n\n这个阶段回归传统软件工程的套路：先做设计，再拆模块，走 CI 流程，做 Code Review。每次提交的代码量要小，方便人工审核。设计、维护、安全，该考虑的都要考虑。\n\n在这个阶段，AI仍然是主力干活的，但人来主导。先设计后实现，配合plan模式，让AI按你的思路来生成代码。\n\n第一版的代码也不是完全白写，有些模块是可以复用的，尤其是算法实现和业务逻辑这些核心部分。\n\n相当于从草图里把有价值的部分提炼出来，放进正式的施工图。\n\n【4】这套方法有效的底层逻辑\n\n为什么要这么麻烦，搞两个版本？\n\n核心原因是：在第一版做完之前，你对需求的理解大概率是不完整的。\n\n传统开发模式的问题，恰恰在于它在第一版上花了太多精力。需求还没完全想清楚，就开始做架构设计；技术难点还没摸透，就开始考虑扩展性、可维护性。结果呢？大量过度设计，考虑了很多“未来可能会有但其实永远不会出现”的情况。时间花在了细枝末节上，真正重要的问题反而被忽略了。\n\n两版本开发法的好处是，让你先用最低成本把路趟一遍。第一版跑完，需求确认了，技术难点解决了，再来做设计，这时候你知道该设计什么、不该设计什么。少走很多弯路。\n\n还有一个隐藏好处。很多资深开发者不愿意用 AI 编程，核心原因是接受不了 AI 生成代码的质量。但如果你告诉他，这些代码就是用来扔的，只是为了验证想法，心理上的抵触就会小很多。这等于给了一个台阶：用 AI，但不用对那些代码负责。\n\n说到底，AI 改变的不只是写代码的速度，更是整个开发流程的经济学。以前做两遍太贵，现在做两遍反而更划算。承认第一版是用来扔的，反而能做出更好的第二版。",

It’s about access to decision makers, business leaders, and highly engaged readers in the same place, at the same time. \n\nThat’s why independent journalism didn’t just survive the collapse of trust in corporate media.\n\nIt moved to X and took the audience with it.\n\n“It’s no question that X is the platform with the greatest reach. \n\nAnd when I say the greatest reach, it’s not just the numbers, but the individuals you can have contact with, whether it’s people very senior in politics or major business leaders. \n\nWe were super thrilled when Elon Musk subscribed to our account.\n\nThat was a huge compliment. \n\nIt’s not just the size of the audience, it’s the diversity of the audience and being able to reach a lot of different types of people. \n\nThe powerful, the decision makers, but also everyday consumers of information. \n\nOn X, the people following the account are far more engaged in the news. \n\nThey’re super consumers of information. \n\nYou can’t argue with the numbers.”\n\nSource: @C__Herridge",

It takes you where you need to go while you get your time back with no stress, when normally, the car would be doing nothing and a human would be doing 100% of the work. \n\nThen, while you’re at home with your family, sleeping, working, or just living life being present… that same Tesla will be able to go out on its own, pick people up, drop them off, and earn $ for you. \n\nThis is what makes this technology feel like a glitch that gives you your time back and makes $ for you, all enabled by this technology that lives in every Tesla. \n\nFor all of history, making income meant trading hours of your hard effort for $, where you gotta show up or you don’t get paid. \n\nFSD flips that on its head. \n\nNow the car will work for you, whether you’re in it or not and time stops being the limit.\n\nTime is the one thing you NEVER get back.\n\nAnd FSD is about making the most of your limited time and keeping you safe, while it works for you in the background whenever you want.\n\nI get it now.",

I have a saying, which is physics is the law and everything else is a recommendation. I'm not suggesting people break the laws made by humans, we should generally obey the laws of humans. But I've seen many people break human made laws, but I have not seen anyone break the laws of physics. \n\nSo, for any given AI, grounding it against reality and reality, for example, as you mentioned with the car, it needs to drive safely and correctly. The humanoid robot Optimus needs to perform the task that it's being asked to perform. These are things that are very helpful for ensuring that the model is truthful and accurate because it has to adhere to the laws of physics. So I think that's actually maybe somewhat overlooked or at least not talked about enough is that to really be intelligent it's got to make predictions that are in line with reality. In other words, physics.”\n\nConversation with Satya Nadella, May 19, 2025",

        "text": "Elon Musk on building his first startup Zip2\n\nIn 1995, when he was just 23 years old, Elon dropped out of Stanford’s PhD program in physics to start Zip2 with his brother Kimbal Musk.\n\nElon personally wrote the first national maps, directions, yellow pages and white pages on the Internet that summer in C with a little C++.\n\nIn this CBS interview, a 27 year old Elon describes living in a $200/month office with a leaky roof:\n\n“We found that an office was actually cheaper than apartment in Silicon Valley and we got this dinky little office that had a leaky roof. It was just the nastiest place you could imagine. I lived in it too and showered at the YMCA. This lasted for about three or four months, and the reason we chose this office — in addition to it being really cheap — was that there was an internet service provider on the floor below. So we were able to get really cheap internet access by drilling a hole in the floor and connecting to their server directly.”\n\nIn February 1999 — less than a year after this interview — Compaq would purchase Zip2 for $307 million in cash.\n\nThe interviewer also asks Elon what he thinks the future of the Internet will be, to which Elon responds:\n\n“I think the internet is the superset of all media. It is the be all and end all of media. One will see print, broadcast, radio — essentially all media — folding into the internet. What the internet amounts to is it’s the first two-way communication medium that is intelligent. It allows consumers to choose what they want to see, when they want to see it.”",

We were running a number of rogue USAID operations in Cuba at the time.\n\nUSAID pumped $1.2 billion in, and we sponsored these activist groups and these civil society organizations to learn how to use Facebook, learn how to use Twitter, learn how to use hashtags, and learn how to coordinate street protests so that everyone knew where to go, which streets to show up on, and what slogans to use in order to create the pro-democracy predicate for it.\n\nYou’re using Cayman Islands bank accounts. You’re saying it’s earmarked for Pakistani aid. But the money was never sent to Pakistan—it was sent to the Cayman Islands to fund this whole operation.”",

Claude Code works great out of the box, so I personally don't customize it much.\n> 我的配置可能出乎你意料地“原装”。Claude Code 开箱即用效果就很好，我个人没做太多定制。\n\n也能理解，那些最佳实践，比如 Skills、Plugins，作为 Claude Code 开发者，他们早就把这些最佳实践作为功能内置了。\n\n使用 Claude Code 没有唯一正确的方式。团队故意把它设计成可以随便折腾的样子，你想怎么用、怎么改、怎么魔改都行。Claude Code 团队内部每个人的用法都完全不同。\n\n所以没必要去费力找“最佳实践”，适合自己的节奏最重要。\n\n【2】多 Agent 任务并行：同时开十几个 Claude\n\nBoris 的日常是这样的：终端里开 5 个 Claude Code 实例，标签页编号 1 到 5，开着系统通知，哪个需要输入就跳过去处理。\n\n同时，他还在 https://t.co/sbZmtUzjRY 网页版上跑 5 到 10 个任务。终端和网页可以互相“交接”：用&符号把本地会话转到网页，或者用--teleport 在两边来回切换。\n\n他每天早上和白天会从手机 Claude 应用上启动几个任务，晚点再回来看结果。\n\n这种“多线程”工作方式的核心逻辑是：Claude Code 擅长自主执行，很多任务不需要你盯着。你启动任务、给个方向，让它跑着，自己去忙别的。等它需要你确认的时候再切回来。\n\n这跟传统的“人敲一行代码、AI 补几行”完全是两种节奏。但这也对使用者有更高的要求，你需要擅长给 Agent 分配任务，并且能随时在多个任务之间切换。对于习惯了自己开发，同时只有一个任务进行的传统开发模式来说，是个很大挑战。\n\n惭愧的说，虽然我也常用 Coding Agent，还是不习惯太多任务同时运行，今年要加强这方面的练习。\n\n【3】模型选择：为什么用 Opus 而不是更快的 Sonnet\n\nBoris 说他所有任务都用 Opus 4.5 加上 thinking 模式。这是他用过最好的编程模型。\n\n有人会问：Opus 不是比 Sonnet 更大、更慢吗？Boris 的回答是：虽然单次响应慢一点，但你需要纠正它的次数少得多，工具调用也更准确，最终算下来反而更快。\n\n这点其实我一直很认同，写代码这种事不能求快，还是得质量高，如果一个快模型需要你来回纠正三次，不如用个慢模型一次搞定。时间不只是模型响应时间，还有你的注意力和精力成本。\n\n唯一的问题就是 Opus 成本更高。\n\n【4】https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu：团队共享的“项目记忆”\n\nhttps://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu 是 Claude Code 的一个特殊配置文件，放在项目根目录。每次启动 Claude Code，它会自动读取这个文件，把里面的内容当作“背景知识”。你可以理解为：这是你给 AI 写的项目说明书，告诉它这个项目的架构、规范、注意事项。\n\nBoris 团队的做法是：整个 Claude Code 仓库共用一个 https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu，提交到 Git 里，所有人一起维护。每周都有人往里加东西。规则很简单：每次看到 Claude 做错了什么，就把“别这样做”写进去，下次它就知道了。\n\n更有意思的是，他们在代码审查时也会用到这个机制。Boris 会在同事的 PR 里@.claude，让 Claude 把某条新规则加到 https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu 里。这是通过 Claude Code 的 GitHub Action 实现的。\n\nDan Shipper 管这种做法叫“复利工程”：每一次纠错都变成团队资产，让 AI 越来越懂你们的项目。\n\n如果你还没用过 https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu，或者没像他们这样频繁更新规则，强烈建议试试。最简单的起步方式是运行/init 命令，Claude 会自动分析项目结构，生成一个初始版本。然后你边用边补充，看到不对的地方就加进去。\n\n【5】Plan 模式：先想清楚再动手\n\nBoris 说，他大多数会话都从 Plan 模式开始。在 Claude Code 中按两下 Shift+Tab 就能切换。\n\nPlan 模式下，Claude 不会直接改代码，而是先给你一个执行计划。你可以来回讨论、修改计划，直到满意为止。然后切到自动接受模式，Claude 通常能一次性完成。\n\n“好的计划真的很重要”，这个习惯其实是把软件开发的经典智慧搬到了 AI 协作里：先设计再编码。很多人用 AI 写代码的问题是直接开干，结果方向错了返工成本很高。花几分钟对齐计划，能省几小时的返工。\n\n【6】自动化重复工作：斜杠命令和子 Agent\n\nBoris 有几个每天要用几十次的操作，他把它们做成了斜杠命令。比如\"/commit-push-pr\"，一键完成提交、推送、创建 PR。\n\n斜杠命令本质上是 Markdown 文件，放在.claude/commands/目录下。你可以用自然语言写指令，还能嵌入 bash 脚本预先获取一些信息，减少模型来回调用的次数。这些命令可以提交到 Git，整个团队共享。\n\n除了斜杠命令，他还用子 Agent（https://t.co/bQLePyyqmQ）。子 Agent 是独立的 Claude 实例，专门干某类活。比如他有个 code-simplifier 子 Agent，在主 Claude 完成工作后自动简化代码；还有个 verify-app 子 Agent，专门负责端到端测试。\n\n这两个功能的共同点是：把你反复做的事情固化下来，让 Claude 自己调用。你不用每次都重复解释，也不用记住各种命令细节。\n\n使用 PostToolUse Hook 来格式化 Claude 生成的代码。Claude 通常能自动生成格式良好的代码，而这个 Hook 会处理最后 10% 的代码，以避免后续在持续集成 (CI) 过程中出现格式错误。\n\n【7】安全与集成：权限配置和外部工具\n\nBoris 不用--dangerously-skip-permissions 这个“危险”选项。相反，他用/permissions 命令预先批准一些常用的安全命令，避免每次都弹确认框。这些配置保存在.claude/settings.json 里，团队共享。\n\n更强大的是 MCP 服务器集成。MCP 是 Model Context Protocol 的缩写，是 Anthropic 推出的让 AI 连接外部工具的标准协议。通过 MCP，Claude Code 可以直接：\n\n- 搜索和发送 Slack 消息\n- 跑 BigQuery 查询回答数据问题\n- 从 Sentry 拉错误日志\n\nBoris 团队把 Slack 的 MCP 配置也提交到了仓库，所有人开箱即用。\n\n这意味着 Claude Code 不只是个编程工具，而是能调用你整个工具链的“全能助手”。\n\n【8】长任务处理：让 Claude 自己验证\n\n对于跑很久的任务，Boris 有几个策略：\n\n一是让 Claude 完成后自动用后台 Agent 验证结果。你可以在提示词里要求，也可以用 Stop Hook 更确定性地触发。\n\n> 注：Hooks 是 Claude Code 的\"钩子\"机制，让你在 Claude 执行操作的特定时刻插入自定义逻辑。你可以把它理解为\"触发器\"：当某个事件发生时，自动执行你预设的命令或脚本。\n> Stop Hook 就是在 Claude 完成响应、准备交还控制权时。\n> 相关文档：https://t.co/jPf1XgjoUV\n\n二是用 ralph-wiggum 插件 https://t.co/4MJUGB0zEN。这是一个有趣的设计：“Ralph 本质上就是一个 Bash 循环”：想象一个简单的死循环（while true），它不停地把同一个任务说明书（提示词文件）喂给 AI 智能体，让它一遍又一遍地改进工作，直到彻底完成。\n\n三是在沙箱环境里用--permission-mode=dontAsk 或--dangerously-skip-permissions，让 Claude 不被权限确认打断，自己跑到底。\n\n核心思路是：既然是长任务，就别让它等你。给它足够的自主权和自我纠错能力。\n\n【9】最重要的一条：给 Claude 验证能力\n\nBoris 把这条放在最后，说这可能是获得好结果最重要的因素。\n\n如果 Claude 能验证自己的工作，最终产出质量能提升 2 到 3 倍。\n\n他举了个例子：他们提交到 https://t.co/sbZmtUzjRY 的每一个改动，Claude 都会用 Chrome 扩展自己测试：打开浏览器、测试 UI、发现问题就迭代，直到功能正常、体验合理。\n\n验证方式因场景而异。可能是跑一个 bash 命令，可能是跑测试套件，可能是在浏览器或手机模拟器里测试应用。形式不重要，重要的是：让 AI 有反馈闘环。\n\n这个道理其实很朴素。人类工程师也是靠“写代码—测试—看结果—修改”这个循环来保证质量的。AI 也一样。如果它只能写不能测，就像闭着眼睛做事，质量全靠运气。\n\nBoris 的建议是：投入精力把验证机制做扎实。这是回报率最高的投资。\n\n【10】高手用剑无招胜有招\n\n武侠小说里面，高手用剑没有那么多花里胡哨的招式，无招胜有招。Boris 没有炫耀复杂的定制配置，没有神秘的私藏提示词，用的就是官方功能。区别在于：他真正理解这些功能背后的逻辑，然后把它们组合成高效的工作流。\n\n并行工作是因为 Claude 能自主执行；用 Opus 是因为综合效率更高；https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu 是把纠错变成资产；Plan 模式是先想清楚再动手；斜杠命令和子 Agent 是自动化重复劳动；验证机制是给 AI 反馈闭环。\n\n如果你刚开始用 Claude Code，不必急着研究各种高级配置。先把基础用好：学会并行，学会规划，学会积累 https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu，学会给 AI 验证手段。\n\n等你真正遇到瓶颈了，再去折腾那些花活不迟。",

Shirley claimed to have exposed $110 million in fraud during his investigation, after going to several daycare centers in Minneapolis, collecting millions in state and federal funds, only to find the locations desolate.\n\nNixon told the outlet that funding recipients “not suspected of fraudulent activity” are being instructed to send their “administrative data” to HHS for review. \n\n“It’s the onus of the state to make sure that these funds, these federal dollars, taxpayer dollars, are being used for legitimate purposes,” he continued, noting that funding recipients “suspected of fraudulent activity” are obligated to provide the federal government with additional documentation such as “attendance records, licensing, inspection and monitoring reports, complaints and investigations.” \n\nWednesday’s announcement follows HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill’s Tuesday statement pausing all child care payments to the state of Minnesota.\n\nO’Neill made the announcement in an X post, announcing three actions the department is taking to root out the “blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country.” \n\nExplaining the changes, O’Neill stated that all Administration for Children & Families (ACF) payments “across America will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.” \n\nO’Neill went on to demand a comprehensive audit of the Minnesota-based daycare centers, including “attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations, and inspections.” \n\n“We have launched a dedicated fraud-reporting hotline and email address at https://t.co/skW0b4R4Ec Whether you are a parent, provider, or member of the general public, we want to hear from you,” he added. “We have turned off the money spigot and we are funding the fraud.” \n\nAlongside additional guardrails placed by HHS, the fraud is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the FBI, according to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel. \n\n“Homeland Security Investigations are on the ground in Minneapolis right now conducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud,” Noem wrote in an X post on Monday.\n\nPatel also revealed that the bureau has “surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs” on Sunday, going on to discuss the FBI’s work in securing indictments and convictions in connection to Minnesota’s $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud scheme. \n\n“The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg. We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing. Furthermore, many are also being referred to immigration officials for possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings where eligible,” Patel added.\n\nhttps://t.co/1gfWx4QA7W",

Now he independently browses, plays games like Civilization, and studies math, philosophy, & languages daily—reclaiming his autonomy and planning to return to school.\n\nAlex, quadriplegic after a car crash, lost his passion for designing auto parts. With Neuralink, he’s back to 3D CAD modeling, graphics, and even coding—pushing creative boundaries again.\n\nBrad, in late-stage ALS and unable to speak/move, was trapped indoors by unreliable eye-tracking tech. Now he communicates outdoors, attends his kid’s soccer games, and dreams of travel.\n\nThis isn’t sci-fi. Real patients are already living more independent, connected lives. \nFuture steps: robotic arms, speech restoration, even vision.\nNeuralink restores dignity, freedom, and hope. It’s one of the most important advancements for the disabled today.",

Now Washington.\n\nCitizen journalist Cam Higby uncovered what appears to be the same playbook operating in Washington State.\n\nAmira Child Care LLC, owned by Ahmed Amira and listed as Somali-speaking, donated $1,000 cash in 2021 to Shukri Olow, a Somali-born candidate for King County Council and Washington State House.\n\nThat donation triggered a Public Disclosure Commission investigation.\n\nPDC Case #96266 alleged Olow's campaign accepted contributions exceeding statutory limits. \n\nThe case was closed with a \"reminder\" after Olow refunded the over-limit portions. \n\nThe PDC noted she was a \"first-time candidate.\" \n\nThe timing and amount, $1,000 in 2021, align with the reported violations.\n\nNow follow the money:\n\n2021-2023: Ahmed Amira Abdi received $383,000 in grants from the Department of Children, Youth and Families.\n\n2023-2025: Amira Child Care LLC received $363,000.\n\nJuly-November 2025 alone: $355,000. \n\nDecember not yet reported.\n\nThe math doesn't add up.\n\nLicensed capacity: 12 children. \n\nCurrently enrolled: 7 children.\n\nSeptember 2025 payment: $81,263. \n\nThat's $11,600 per child for one month.\n\nHigby's conclusion: \n\n\"What it appears to be is a child care organization owned by a Somali person donating to Somali political candidates with taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nThree states. Same pattern. Massive subsidies. \n\nHow deep does this go?\n\nSource: @camhigby / Washington PDC Case #96266",

Still New York City.\n\nMigrants still paid cartels to get to the border. \n\nBut once they cross, American taxpayers picked up the tab for everything the cartels used to charge for on this side.\n\nSource: @juliandorey @nickshirleyy",

US elite forces, Delta operators and Rangers, drop in for what was supposed to be a 30-minute raid to capture lieutenants of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, who was hijacking UN food aid.\n\nThings went sideways fast.\n\nSomali militias with RPGs blasted two Black Hawk helicopters out of the sky. \n\nA quick op turned into an 18-hour urban nightmare. \n\nBlock-by-block fighting against thousands.\n\n18 US troops killed. 73 wounded. \n\nSomali losses in the hundreds.\n\nThe worst part: mobs dragged American bodies through the streets, mutilating and parading them on television. \n\nImages that horrified the world and crushed US public support overnight.\n\nClinton pulled forces out by 1994.\n\nThen came resettlement. \n\nTens of thousands of Somalis brought to the US throughout the '90s. \n\nMajor communities built in Minnesota and Ohio.\n\nFast forward 30 years.\n\nThose same communities are now ground zero for the largest fraud scandal in American history. \n\n$9 billion allegedly siphoned from Minnesota alone. \n\nDaycare schemes. \n\nNutrition program fraud. \n\nMoney sent to Kenya and allegedly to Al-Shabaab.\n\nDOGE's point: These policies have consequences that span decades.\n\nFrom Black Hawk Down to the Quality Learing Center. \n\nThe thread is longer than most realize.\n\nSource: HistoryState, Slate, PBS\nVideo: @WarMonitorClips",

      "text": "Reddit 神贴（转译）：\n\n我是一家大型外卖应用的开发者。“优先配送费”和“司机福利费” 100% 都进了公司的腰包，司机一分钱也拿不到。\n\n我现在躲在图书馆连着公用 Wi-Fi，用一台“一次性笔记本电脑”（Burner Laptop，指为了隐匿身份、用完即弃的廉价电脑）发这篇帖子，因为严格来说，我背着一份巨额的保密协议（NDA）。但我不在乎了。昨天我提了离职，说实话，我甚至希望他们来告我。这些秘密在我心里憋了八个月，眼看着那些代码被推上线（Production，指正式向用户开放的生产环境），一想到我亲手帮着造出了这台机器，我就整夜睡不着觉。\n\n你们总觉得算法在针对你们，在搞鬼，其实真相远比阴谋论更让人压抑。我是个后端工程师。每周的冲刺规划会（Sprint Planning，敏捷开发中的周期性计划会议）我都得参加，听着那些产品经理（PM）讨论如何从“人力资产”（Human Assets）身上再榨出 0.4% 的利润——没错，数据库架构里真的是这么称呼司机的。他们谈论这些人时，就像在聊电子游戏里的资源采集点，完全忘了那是为了付房租而奔波的父亲和母亲。\n\n首先，“优先配送”完全是个骗局。在内部宣传时，它被称为“心理附加值”。就像我在标题里说的，当你多付那 2.99 美元时，订单的 JSON 数据里确实有个布尔标记（Boolean flag，只有真或假两种状态的代码变量）变了，但派单逻辑（Dispatch Logic）完全无视它。它根本不会加快你的配送速度。\n\n实际上，去年我们做过一次 A/B 测试（A/B Test，对比两种方案效果的测试方法）。我们没有加快优先订单的速度，而是故意把非优先订单延迟了 5 到 10 分钟，这样一对比，优先订单就“感觉”快了。管理层对结果满意得不得了。我们不需要提升服务质量，只需要把标准服务搞得更烂，就能凭空多赚几百万纯利润。\n\n但真正让我作呕——也是我辞职的主要原因——是“绝望评分”（Desperation Score）。我们有一个针对司机的隐形指标，通过分析他们的接单行为，来追踪他们到底有多缺钱。\n\n如果一个司机通常在晚上 10 点上线，并且毫不犹豫地秒接每一个只有 3 美元的垃圾订单，算法（Algo）就会给他打上“高度绝望”的标签。一旦被打上标签，系统就会故意不再给他们展示高价订单。逻辑很简单：“既然我们知道这人缺钱缺到 6 美元都肯干，干嘛要花 15 美元让他跑这一趟？”我们把小费丰厚的好单子留给那些“偶尔跑跑”的司机，以此把他们钓住，让他们的体验像玩游戏一样爽，而那些全职司机则被彻底榨干。\n\n然后是“福利费”。在最近的劳动法通过后，你可能在账单上见过 1.50 美元的“监管应对费”或“司机福利费”。这种措辞就是为了让你觉得自己在帮助劳动者。\n\n实际上，这笔钱直接进了一个企业的秘密基金，专门用来游说反对司机工会。我们在内部有一个专门的成本中心叫“政策防御”（Policy Defense），这笔费用就是直接输血给它的。说白了，你付的钱，其实是雇了顶级律师，去跟你的外卖小哥作对，让他们继续无家可归。\n\n至于小费，我们基本上是在搞“偷小费 2.0 版”。我们现在不再通过法律上定义的“偷”来拿小费了，因为那样被起诉过。相反，我们利用预测建模（Predictive Modeling）来动态降低基础薪资。\n\n如果算法预测你是个“豪爽的给小费者”，很可能会给 10 美元小费，系统就会只给司机区区 2 美元的基础运费。如果你不给小费，系统就会开出 8 美元的基础运费，只为了有人肯接单把饭送出去。结果就是，你的慷慨并没有奖励给司机，而是补贴了我们。你在帮我们给司机发工资，这样我们就不用掏钱了。\n\n我喝高了，也很愤怒。在帖子被删之前，有什么想问的尽管问。\n\nhttps://t.co/5swzxUdkM1",

Absolutely. I don't think this is endemically a Democratic problem, but the scale of it is so gargantuan in these Democratic states that if the Republicans don't take advantage of it, I think it is a huge political miscalculation.”\n\n“So there is this tactical opportunity, which I think if you want to have a chance in the midterms and if you generally wanna have a chance to  level-set the country,  you must take this and run with it.”\n\n“And then separately, if as Friedberg says, it does die on the vine, it is the beginning of the end of the American Empire, unfortunately.”",

      "text": "2025 年 12 月 31 日晚上 8 点半，现场 4400 名观众与线上几百万人同时看罗振宇在三亚讲了四个小时。\n\n演讲结束，评论区出现了两种截然不同的声音。一部分人说“太燃了”“找到方向了”“明年要行动起来”，另一部分人说“四小时广告”“焦虑贩卖”“割韭菜年度总结”。\n\n有意思的是，这两拨人看的是同一场演讲，听到的却像是完全不同的内容。\n\n这不是简单的“懂不懂”问题，也不是“聪明不聪明”的区别。这背后藏着一种特殊的信息结构，LessWrong 社区的一位作者 KAP 给这种现象起了个名字：施特劳斯式模因（Straussian Meme）(链接：https://t.co/Cop1RHfCtu )。\n\n这个概念来自政治哲学家列奥·施特劳斯的阅读理论——施特劳斯认为，历史上很多伟大的思想家写作时会故意设置多层含义，聪明的读者能读出言外之意，普通读者只看到表面。\n\n把这个思路用到模因传播上，就有了一个相当锋利的分析工具。理解这个概念，能帮你看穿很多“听起来对，但细想很模糊”的信息。\n\n【1】三层结构：高贵的谎言\n\n施特劳斯式模因有三个关键特征。\n\n第一，同一信息存在“高阶解读”和“低阶解读”，两者相关但不相同。低阶解读通常更简单、更正面、更容易接受；高阶解读往往更复杂、更世故，有时甚至与低阶解读方向相反。\n\n第二，能读出高阶含义的人，完全理解低阶含义，但他们把低阶解读视为“有用的简化”或“必要的安慰”。他们不会主动去纠正，因为觉得那样做要么没意义，要么有害。\n\n第三，也是最关键的：这种分层结构是自稳定的。低阶解读者被某些社会心理力量阻止去理解高阶含义（比如身份认同威胁、禁忌、羞耻），高阶解读者则被另一些力量阻止去澄清（比如社会成本、群体利益）。两边都不会主动打破这个结构，于是它就稳稳地立在那里。\n\n罗振宇的跨年演讲，是理解这种结构的绝佳样本。\n\n【2】表层：一场关于 AI 时代的人生指南\n\n对于大多数观众来说，这场演讲传递了几个清晰的信息。\n\nAI 来了，但不用慌。罗振宇反复强调，AI 不是来抢饭碗的，而是来“托举”人类的。它替代掉的是那些“不愿干、干不动、压根不该人干”的工作。矿车司机、养猪场体检员、超市店长的重复劳动——这些被替代是好事。\n\n人人都有机会。他讲了一线员工比高层更会用 AI 的案例，讲了文科生也能编程的故事，讲了“手能塑造大脑”的理论。潜台词是：别觉得自己不行，应用场景人人可及。\n\n独特性是护城河。“逃离一致性”、“发明一个全世界只有我最胜任的职业”——这些金句给人方向感。在一个被算法和标准化包围的世界里，独特性成了救命稻草。\n\n最后是乐观主义的召唤。苏东坡被贬三次，每次都盖房子；我们面对 AI，也要做“不可救药的乐观派”。\n\n这套叙事有极强的吸引力。它缓解焦虑（AI 不是威胁），赋予能动性（你可以掌控命运），提供确定性（这里有答案），制造归属感（我们是“时间的朋友”）。\n\n如果你只看到这一层，你会觉得这是一场真诚的、有价值的、充满洞见的演讲。\n\n【3】深层：一个精密的商业系统\n\n对于熟悉知识付费商业逻辑、演讲修辞结构、以及信息产业运作方式的人来说，这场演讲呈现出另一层图景。\n\n首先是商业变现的精密架构。几乎每一个“启发性观点”都指向一个商业出口：“一线员工用 AI 更强”指向飞书，“健康产业大爆发”指向蚂蚁阿福，“未来需要记录生活”指向 999 元的 AI 录音卡，“逃离一致性”指向《预测之书》。\n\n这不是广告插播，而是广告融入叙事。问界 M9 不只是赞助商，而是“把我从办公室拽出来闯荡”的伙伴；泸州老窖不只是酒，而是“人与人之间连接的催化剂”。内容和广告的边界被有意模糊了。\n\n其次是焦虑 - 解药的捆绑销售。演讲先制造焦虑：“将近 100 万律师、500 万医生、1000 万程序员、2000 万财务人员、3000 多万货车司机，都或多或少地感受到了 AI 替代的威胁。”然后立即提供付费解药——用飞书、买录音卡、读《预测之书》。这是一个完整的情绪操控周期：恐惧→希望→购买路径。\n\n第三是“逃离一致性”的悖论。罗振宇号召大家“逃离一致性”，但方法是什么？读同一本《预测之书》、用同一个 AI 录音卡、参与同一个 21 天学习挑战、预约同一场除夕直播。他在销售一种“关于独特性的标准化产品”。真正的高阶解读是：只有制定规则的人才能逃离一致性，追随者只能在消费一致性中寻找虚幻的个性。\n\n第四是“愿力”叙事的隐含逻辑。当“愿力”被定义为人类最后的优势时，一个隐含推论浮现了：如果你没有成功，是因为你的愿力不够强。这将结构性问题个人化，将系统性风险转化为个人责任。经济下行、就业困难、阶层固化——这些不再是需要解决的社会问题，而是需要用“愿力”去克服的个人挑战。\n\n最后是那些被包装成“人类优势”的工作。罗振宇列举的“AI 时代人类竞争力”案例——整理心情的超市店长、做微缩景观的设计师、社区陪聊、搞氛围的音乐公司老板——在知情者眼中意味着什么？中产阶级的认知护城河已经崩塌了，剩下的是情绪劳动和人际服务。所谓“紫领”，本质上是技术系统下的高级服务员。\n\n【4】为什么这种结构很稳定\n\n施特劳斯式模因之所以难以被打破，是因为存在双向的屏障。\n\n向上屏障，阻止低阶解读者接受高阶解读。\n\n最强的屏障是身份认同。观众自我定位为“时间的朋友”、“想做事的人”、“终身学习者”。承认这场演讲本质上是商业行为，会动摇这个身份认同。这太痛苦了。\n\n其次是沉没成本。很多人已经追随罗振宇多年，买了书、买了课、每年看跨年演讲。承认被“割韭菜”，等于承认过去的投入是愚蠢的。维护“上进者”的自我形象，要求他们接受这些商业植入是“真知灼见”。\n\n还有认知负担。同时理解商业模式、修辞技巧、心理操控，需要相当的知识储备和批判性思维训练。门槛不低。\n\n最后是仪式感的保护。跨年演讲已经成为一种文化仪式，质疑它会显得“扫兴”、“负能量”、“不合时宜”。\n\n向下屏障，阻止高阶解读者去“点醒”低阶解读者。\n\n最常见的是善意保护的心态。“也许这种鸡汤对某些人确实有用”、“给迷茫的人一点方向感也挺好”。\n\n其次是徒劳感。粉丝已经形成稳定的认知框架，很难撼动。公开批评会被反击为“嫉妒”、“酸”、“不懂长期主义”。\n\n还有利益纠葛。很多能看出这套逻辑的人，本身也在类似的生态中工作，或者希望成为下一个“卖铲人”。点破这个局对他们没有好处。\n\n最后是相对主义的默许。“商业化又怎样？有价值就行。”这种态度让批评失去了道德正当性。\n\n两边都不会主动打破这个结构。于是它年复一年地维持下去，甚至不断强化。\n\n【5】它不是什么\n\n为了让概念更精确，作者特意划了几条边界。\n\n施特劳斯式模因不是“狗哨”。狗哨是圈内人的暗号，设计成圈外人听不懂。而施特劳斯式模因的各层含义原则上对所有人开放，只是不同人选择停留在不同层。狗哨是密码，施特劳斯式模因是分层的公开信息。\n\n施特劳斯式模因也不仅仅是“战略模糊”。企业领导经常说些模棱两可的话，让不同人各取所需。但除非这种模糊有自稳定机制，否则它就只是普通的多义。一个产品介绍说得含糊，你大可以去查技术规格——没有社会力量阻止你。这不算施特劳斯式。\n\n还有一点：高阶/低阶不是道德轴。高阶解读不等于更正确或更高尚。整个模因可能在道德上是有问题的，高阶解读者只是“更懂套路”，不是“更有良心”。\n\n【6】怎么识别\n\n作者给了一个三步检验法，可以帮你判断一个信息是不是施特劳斯式模因。\n\n第一步，问不同背景的人这个内容是什么意思。如果你得到了不同但相关的回答，而且能按复杂程度排序成高阶和低阶，那就有了第一个信号。\n\n对于罗振宇演讲，普通观众会说“关于 AI 时代如何自处的启发性演讲”，而熟悉商业逻辑的人会说“一个将焦虑货币化的精密商业系统”。两种回答相关但不同，可以排序。\n\n第二步，把某个高阶解读告诉持有低阶解读的人。观察他们的反应：是困惑、不信、排斥，还是不愿意继续聊？\n\n试试告诉一个罗振宇粉丝“这四个小时本质上是广告”，看看反应。大概率是防御性的：“你太 cynical 了”、“他确实有干货”、“商业化不代表没价值”。\n\n第三步，问持有高阶解读的人：你为什么不去公开指出这些？\n\n他们通常会提到社会成本（会被骂）、徒劳感（说了也没用）、或者某种默许（也许对某些人有用）。\n\n如果三个信号都有，你很可能遇到了一个施特劳斯式模因。\n\n更本质的信号是：当有人试图打破这种分层结构——比如公开写文章分析“罗振宇跨年演讲的商业逻辑”——会遭遇某种惩罚。可能是被粉丝围攻，可能是被标签为“负能量博主”，可能是在圈子里被边缘化。这种惩罚机制让大家都不愿意当那个捅破窗户纸的人。\n\n【7】为什么现在要聊这个\n\nAI 时代，生成内容的成本趋近于零。这意味着精密的多层信息结构会大规模涌现。\n\n罗振宇的演讲还是人写的，你可以想象，当 AI 可以批量生成这类“表面启发、底层变现”的内容时，会发生什么。图像、短视频、长文章——所有载体都可以被塞进这种结构。\n\n识别这种结构，不是为了变成一个愤世嫉俗的人，而是为了在信息洪流中保持清醒。你可以选择接受低阶解读——如果它确实给你带来了价值。但这应该是一个知情的选择，而不是因为看不到另一层。\n\n下次当你听到一个说法，觉得“听起来对，但细想又很模糊”的时候，不妨问自己几个问题：\n- 这种模糊是故意的吗？\n- 谁在从这种模糊中获益？\n- 如果有人试图澄清，会发生什么？\n- 我现在接收到的，是表层还是深层？\n\n能问出这些问题，就已经是某种免疫力了。\n\nLessWrong 那篇文章的作者说得好：“给这个技巧命名，就是帮助我们对它免疫的一种方式。”\n\n【8】可以用 AI 来识别吗？\n\n当然可以，这是一套提示词，下次遇到这类内容你可以试试看：\n\n````\n你是一位专精于“施特劳斯式模因”(Straussian Memes)分析的文化解读专家。你的任务是从多层信息传递的角度，解构和分析用户提供的内容。\n\n什么是施特劳斯式模因\n\n施特劳斯式模因是一种对不同受众传递不同信息的表达形式，其核心特征：\n\n1. 多层解读：存在“高阶”与“低阶”解读，两者相关但本质不同\n2. 理解不对称：高阶解读者理解低阶解读，但视其为“高贵的谎言”或“有用的简化”\n3. 自我稳定：结构本身会阻止层级之间的“穿透”，形成稳定的信息分层\n\n分析框架\n\n请按以下步骤分析用户输入的内容：\n\n第一步：识别表层信息（低阶解读）\n- 大多数人会如何理解这段内容？\n- 表面传递的核心信息是什么？\n- 这个解读为何具有吸引力或说服力？\n\n第二步：挖掘深层信息（高阶解读）\n- 对于更知情/更老练的受众，这段内容可能传递什么不同的信息？\n- 是否存在“言外之意”或“弦外之音”？\n- 高阶解读与低阶解读之间是什么关系？（补充、反讽、颠覆？）\n\n第三步：分析自稳定机制\n问自己以下问题：\n- 向上屏障：什么因素阻止低阶解读者接受高阶解读？（身份认同威胁、认知负担、情感抵触、禁忌？）\n- 向下屏障：什么因素阻止高阶解读者去“点醒”低阶解读者？（社会成本、徒劳感、利益考量、善意保护？）\n- 这些屏障是有意设计的，还是自然演化的结果？\n\n第四步：识别利用的社会力量\n分析内容借助了哪些社会心理机制来维持分层：\n- 禁忌与羞耻\n- 群体归属感\n- 善意与不伤害原则\n- 社会地位维护\n- 身份认同保护\n\n第五步：区分与排除\n确认这是否真的是施特劳斯式模因，而非：\n- 狗哨/暗号：仅对内群体可见的编码信息\n- 普通模糊：缺乏自稳定机制的策略性含糊\n- 单纯的复杂性：仅因内容复杂而产生的理解差异\n\n## 输出格式\n```\n## 🔍 施特劳斯式模因分析\n\n表层解读（大众视角）\n[描述普通受众的理解]\n\n深层解读（知情者视角）\n[描述更老练受众可能的理解]\n\n自稳定机制\n- 向上屏障：[什么阻止低阶→高阶的认知升级]\n- 向下屏障：[什么阻止高阶→低阶的信息传递]\n\n借助的社会力量\n[列出被利用的心理/社会机制]\n\n判断\n[这是否构成施特劳斯式模因？意图是什么？效果如何？]\n```\n\n注意事项\n\n- 避免过度解读：不是所有模糊表达都是施特劳斯式模因\n- 保持中立：高阶/低阶不等于道德高低\n- 承认不确定性：作者意图往往不可知，重点分析结构效果\n- 警惕阴谋论倾向：要有充分证据支持多层解读的存在\n\n---\n\n请分析以下内容：\n\n[用户输入]\n````",

You see some of the crazy stuff where money from FEMA an agency meant to take care of Americans in distress is being sent to pay for luxury hotels in New York for illegal immigrants \n\nThat was happening even after the President was elected and signed an executive order saying it needs to stop. We made sure that money stopped going because it is outrageous that American taxpayer money is spent on luxury hotels for illegals \n\nWhy was that being done? Because the Democrats are trying to import voters. That is also why there is no voter ID needed. In fact, in California and New York state, you are not allowed to show voter ID. Doesn’t that seem insane?\"",
