If states use their own money to do it, there needs to be a clear paper trail proving that federal dollars didn’t fund those services.\n \nThese states failed to provide that for this $1.8 billion. So today, CMS is announcing that we’re withholding nearly $300 million from California — which is by far the worst offender — until they demonstrate to our satisfaction that they’re spending that money properly.\n \nMedicaid dollars belong to Americans, not illegal immigrants, and we won’t stop until we’ve held rogue states accountable and recovered their misspent funds.\n \nMore announcements to come.",

And my team is getting it back.\n\nSome want to deny that illegal immigrants are receiving Medicaid. Others insist it’s illegal for Medicaid to cover illegal immigrants. And others accurately point out that hospitals can provide emergency services to illegal immigrants under the program.\n\nWe can all agree on this: rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse is essential to protecting this program for the most vulnerable. It’s also one of the Trump Administration’s top priorities. \n\nLet me lay down the facts:\n\nThe truth is that federal law is supposed to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars broadly from being used to cover illegal immigrants. It does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status. States can also legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used. \n\nBut that didn’t stop Democrats from going even further by breaking federal law to give illegal immigrants federal Medicaid dollars meant for American citizens.\n\nEarlier this year, the CMS team began auditing state Medicaid programs to ensure they were following the law and not spending any federal tax dollars on illegal immigrants outside of emergency Medicaid. What we found was shocking. \n\nIn a preliminary review of 6 states, we found those states improperly using federal tax dollars for their allegedly state-funded program and providing coverage to individuals, including some with criminal records of murder and assault.\n\nThose states are:\nCA - $1,310,032,549\nDC - $2,114,628\nIL - $29,778,645\nWA - $2,367,194\nCO - $1,506,743\nOR - $5,404,368\n\nWe notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money. But what if we had never asked?\n\nWhether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise.\n\nDemocrats are demanding the repeal of the President’s Working Families Tax Cuts legislation in order for their votes to reopen the government. This law wisely strengthened our ability to limit federal dollars from being spent on health care for illegal immigrants. Until Democrats explicitly drop that demand, they’re blatantly holding the government hostage over giving Medicaid to illegal immigrants.",

The scale is vertigo-inducing - the rings could wrap around everything you've ever known.

Thousands of stars scattered like crushed diamonds across absolute darkness. Scale is incomprehensible - each pillar contains worlds. Soft god rays pierce through gaps in the dust.

The planet's limb curves away into shadow, a thin bright arc of atmospheric haze glowing where day meets night.

A person would show up, be sent back, and counted as a deportation. We have to do deportations from the interior of the country because Biden and Harris let them walk in.\n\n2) In the cities that are not sanctuary cities, the deportation process is orderly and normal--like most law enforcement. In Minneapolis and a few other sanctuary jurisdictions, local jurisdictions and a few leftwing agitators have decided to wage war on all immigration enforcement officers. \n\nThey are hoping that a little chaos will convince us to give up on immigration enforcement. They are wrong.",

It explicitly states that it doesn’t matter if anyone actually felt hatred or fear. And it allows the government to go back in time and charge people for things they said before the law existed.\n\nThe bill also gives police power to ban groups without due process—including groups outside Australia—and to imprison citizens for up to 15 years for “supporting” them.\n\nAnd while it claims to offer religious protections, a rep from the Attorney General’s Department confirmed that Catholics and Christians will not receive those protections—even as Jewish, Islamic, and Sikh Australians do.\n\nIf you post a Bible verse today, what’s stopping them from calling it hate speech tomorrow?\n\nDon't miss @zeeemedia's report:👇\nhttps://t.co/BqaSyB8g6z",

Actual structure. NGOs, unions, funding vehicles, election timelines. The whole starter kit.\n\nThe guy, Marton Benedek, was sitting inside EU institutions while sketching out a roadmap for protests, messaging, fundraising, even something that reads a lot like a shadow government. \n\nHe talks openly about building a permanent coordination hub to challenge Orban’s rule.\n\nThis was an EU migration and security official, with deep access and zero plausible deniability, not just some street activist.\n\nThe early effort flopped. The party he helped build face-planted electorally. But the playbook didn’t disappear. It just waited.\n\nFast forward and suddenly a brand-new figure, Peter Magyar, drops out of nowhere, gets wall-to-wall Western media love, runs a campaign with serious money and polish, keeps his ideology vague, stays aggressively pro-EU, and rockets to the top of the polls. \n\nNo clear funding trail. No real policy spine. \n\nBut momentum.\n\nThe uncomfortable part for Brussels isn’t whether Orban is good or bad. It’s that this confirms what his supporters have said for years: \n\nThe EU doesn’t just pressure governments. It actively works around them when they won’t comply.\n\nRule of law language on the surface. Regime-management instincts underneath.\n\nIf this were Russia doing it, headlines would be screaming “foreign interference.” \n\nWhen it’s Brussels, it’s called cooperation.\n\nSource: @ZeroHedge",

      "text": "玉伯之前发了一条推文，说问了很多牛人下一个大模型会有什么惊艳发布，其中一个预测是：可实时生成的视频。\n\n其实我当时没太理解什么是实时生成视频，直到我看了 @PixVerse_ R1 的演示视频，实际体验了一把，才算是理解了什么是实时生成视频，以及它带来的想象空间有多大。\n\nPixVerse R1 可以说是全球首个实时生成模型了，是 PixVerse 自研的大模型。\n\n如果你看了这个视频演示，你会发现它和传统的 AI 视频生成完全不是一回事。演示里是一个\"魔法水族箱\"，金鱼在水草间游动，你打一句话，画面立刻响应。输入\"一只小龙虾\"，红色的鳌虾就趴在石子上了；打\"几只蓝色小水母\"，半透明的水母就漂出来了；说\"一条鲨鱼\"，鲨鱼就从左边游进画面。不是生成完再播放，是你说一句、它变一帧，像在跟视频对话。\n\n更厉害的是复杂交互。你打\"一只手伸进去抓鱼\"，真的有只手从上方探入水中捞鱼；说\"用渔网捞\"，绿色的捞网就出现把金鱼网住了。场景也能随便加——\"出现一艘沉船\"，海盗船模型就沉在鱼缸里了；\"掉进去一个棒棒糖\"，红白旋涡的巨型棒棒糖就躺在石子上，超现实。最离谱的是你还能控制镜头：打\"镜头拉远，一个孩子正在看水族箱\"，视角瞬间从鱼缸内部切到外面，一个小男孩背对着你站在水族箱前。\n\n在实际体验的时候，我也发现一个问题：人的反应速度跟不上视频生成的速度。AI 生成太快了，我写提示词的手速跟不上。但这应该不是大问题，完全可以语音指挥，让 AI 来实时写提示词。\n\n实时生成这个方向打开的想象空间太大了。\n\n直播？想象一下，主播说“今天心情好，给我换个海边背景”，下一秒人就站在马尔代夫的沙滩上了。弹幕刷“下雨”，雨就下了；刷“放烟花”，天上就炸开了。观众不再是观众，是共创者。\n\n游戏？你对着屏幕说“我要进一个赛博朋克风格的酒吧”，酒吧就生成出来了，霓虹灯、全息广告、调酒机器人，全是根据你那句话现编的。不需要提前建模，每个玩家看到的世界都不一样。\n\n教育？老师讲二战诺曼底登陆，不用再放 PPT 了，直接说“给我生成一段盟军抢滩的画面”，学生眼前就是士兵跳下登陆艇、冲向海滩的场景。讲到哪，演到哪。\n\n互动影视？男女主角站在分岔路口，观众投票往左走还是往右走，视频实时往那个方向演下去。每个人看到的结局都可能不一样。\n\n这模糊了视频和游戏、直播、互动内容的边界。视频不再是“做好了给你看”的东西，而是“你说了算”的东西。\n\n@PixVerse_ R1 作为第一个吃螃蟹的出现了，接下来看谁跟上。\n\n如果你能实时控制视频里的一切，你第一个想玩什么？",

And so they wouldn’t stay here. They would self-deport and leave.”\n\n“But if you’re gonna give them welfare, and you’re gonna give them food stamps, and you’re gonna give them housing, and you give them this, that, then everybody’s gonna come and just leech off of us and we’re gonna pay, and pay, and pay.”",

I walked into the office and saw my coworker Robert with a terminal up on his computer, Claude CLI running and a red/green diff view on screen.\n\nI was surprised. This was back in the Sonnet 3.5 days, before the model was good at agentic coding. I had just given it a FileEdit tool the day before. Claude CLI was a prototype that I thought it wasn't useful for anything yet. But Robert was already starting to use it to write code & use git for him. I was still using the CLI as a note taker mostly, but I also started making it my go-to tool for using git as a result.",

I'm charging you a percentage of that. That's what I need to get paid.’ And it doesn't matter that it starts with billionaires. What matters is that we're giving the government the right to look into our private property and take a percentage of it every year.”\n\n“The total net worth of billionaires in the US is $8 trillion.”\n\n“The net worth of the US, the middle class, and everyone else is $170 trillion, compared to $8 trillion of the billionaires.”\n\n@chamath:\n\n“They need a way to open the door so that they can go after the real honey pot.”\n\n“The real honeypot is not 200 people.”\n\n@friedberg:\n\n“Just so everyone understands the real goal of this is not to tax billionaires, because there are other ways to tax billionaires.”\n\n“Charge them a capital gains tax if they borrow against their assets that they haven't paid capital gains tax on. Very simple, that can resolve this.”\n\n“Another thing you can do, you can raise the capital gains tax rate. Sounds unpopular. I don't agree with that, but that's another way to deal with this, which is to take the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 30%. You could do that.”\n\n“The real goal of this is to create, for the first time in American history, a private property asset seizure tax. Because they're going after the $170 trillion, not the $8 trillion that the billionaires have.”",

      "text": "Claude 的新功能 Cowork：让 AI 真正帮你干活\n\nClaude Code 本来是给程序员写代码用的，结果大家发现它整理文件、做表格、写报告也很顺手。Anthropic 索性把这套能力包装成了 Cowork，让不会写代码的人也能用上。\n\n【1】Cowork 到底能干啥\n\n你选一个电脑上的文件夹，Claude 就能在里面读文件、改文件、创建新文件。\n\n听起来简单，用起来挺香。比如你下载文件夹乱成一锅粥，让它帮你分类重命名。或者你有一堆消费截图，它能整理成一张 Excel 表。再比如你写了几页凌乱的笔记，它能帮你理顺思路、输出初稿。\n\n和普通对话不一样的是，Cowork 模式下 Claude 更像个真正的助手。你布置任务，它自己规划步骤、一步步执行，中间会告诉你进度。如果你用过 Claude Code，这感觉会很熟悉，因为底层技术是同一套。\n\n【2】还能更强\n\n基础功能只是起点。Cowork 可以接上你已有的连接器，比如 Google Drive、Slack。它还内置了一批技能，能更好地生成文档、PPT 之类的文件。再配上 Chrome 浏览器插件，Claude 甚至能帮你操作网页。\n\n这套设计让工作流变得很丝滑。你不用反复给 Claude 喂上下文，也不用手动把输出转成正确格式。甚至不用等它做完一件事再布置下一件，可以连续丢任务让它并行处理。用 Anthropic 的话说，这感觉不像你一句我一句地聊天，更像给同事留便签。\n\n【3】和 Claude Code 共享技能生态\n\n对 Claude Code 用户来说有个好消息：Cowork 能读取你本地的 https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu 文件和自定义 Skills。\n\n我测试了一下，选择工作文件夹后，Cowork 能看到里面的 https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu 并按指令执行。我在 Claude Code 里配置的写作风格技能，Cowork 里也能直接调用。技能分两类：Anthropic 官方提供的（docx、pptx、pdf 这些）和用户自己创建的，两类都能用。\n\n换句话说，你在 Claude Code 里攒下的工作流配置可以直接迁移过来。Cowork 不是另起炉灶，是同一套体系的图形化入口。\n\n有个坑要注意：Cowork 跑在 Linux 虚拟机里，而你的 Mac 是 ARM 架构。如果技能依赖 node_modules 或本地特定环境（比如浏览器 cookies、特定架构的二进制文件），就跑不了。我试着调用一个需要运行 nodejs 脚本的图片生成技能，报错了——架构不兼容。纯文本类的配置（https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu、写作规范）没问题，涉及本地脚本的技能可能需要额外适配。\n\n【4】安全边界在哪里\n\nClaude 只能访问你明确授权的文件夹和连接器，动作比较大的时候会先问你。但有几件事得提前知道：Claude 可能会误解你的指令，如果你说\"清理一下这个文件夹\"，它可能真的把文件删了。指令要说清楚。\n\n另一个风险是提示词注入，就是攻击者在网页内容里藏一些指令，试图劫持 Claude 的行为。Anthropic 说他们做了防护，但这个领域整个行业都还在摸索。\n\n这些风险不是 Cowork 特有的，只是很多人可能是第一次用这种更自主的 AI 工具。官方建议：刚开始用的时候谨慎点，别一上来就让它处理重要文件。\n\n【5】现在能用吗\n\nCowork 目前是研究预览版，只对 Mac 上的 Claude Max 订阅用户开放。Anthropic 想先看看大家怎么用、有什么反馈，然后快速迭代。后面会加跨设备同步，也会出 Windows 版。\n\n这一步到是意料之中，因为 Claude Code 现在已经被用在很多编程意外的领域，但是门槛略高，限制了使用群体是程序员或者懂点技术的用户，而且脚本执行权限会有很多安全上的隐患。Cowork 一下子降低了使用的门槛，通过图形化界面就可以操作，并且也让使用更安全。\n\n现在还是早期版本，能做的事有限，安全机制也在完善中。但如果你是 Max + Mac 用户，值得一试。",

It said I got divorced. \nTruth is, I was never married. \n\nInstead of begging an anonymous editor to correct this, I highlighted the text and said: \"Nuseir was never married.\"\n\nThis prompted Grok to do the most comprehensive online search I've ever seen. It watched hours of my content and transcribed it. Then it agreed with my suggestion and approved changes to my article instantly. \n\nNow I fully understand what @elonmusk refers to as the truth. It is not a marketing word. It is literally in the design of the system. \n\nGoogle needs to stop surfacing Wikipedia on the first page and replace it with Grokipedia asap.",
