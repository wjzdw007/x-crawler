The other target had convictions for sex assault with penetration in the first degree, domestic violence, and violating a protective order. Both also have convictions for failure to register as sex offenders. They both have final orders of removal from an immigration judge.\n \nThe US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation. The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement. \n\nBoth of these sexual predators remain AT LARGE in St. Paul. We will be providing the public with photos and descriptors to help us locate and apprehend these public safety threats.",

But my conscience will bring me back to this gate.\n\nI was never told I had to renounce my Christian beliefs to do this job.\n\nThey can throw me in a prison cell, but they can’t force me to lie.\"\n\nSource: @EnochBurke",

      "text": "为什么 Claude Skills 的爆发点在 2026 年 1 月？\n\n问：Claude Skills 是去年 10 月中就推出的，为什么现在才突然火起来？\n\n这是个很好的问题。Claude Skills 确实在 2025 年 10 月中旬就发布了，但直到 2026 年 1 月才真正爆火。这背后有表面原因，也有更深层的逻辑。核心原因就是这东西如果只能在技术圈自嗨，它是火不起来的。去年 10 月份 Skills 编程领域其实很快就开始用起来了，而现在火，只是因为它出圈了，在技术之外的领域火起来了，非技术人员也用起来了。\n\nSkills 真正的价值其实是在非编程领域。去年 Coding Agent（比如 Claude Code、OpenCode）开始在非编程领域开花，而 Skills 的设计特点让它能很快找到 Agent 在非编程领域上的场景落地。\n\n1. 有 bash 和脚本能力，可以自动化本机操作\n\nSkills 让 Claude 能借助代码脚本操作你的本机系统，把很多琐碎的电脑操作变成自动化操作。\n\nClaude Code 的创建者 Boris Cherny 在 X 上分享过一个有趣的观察：自从 Claude Code 发布以来，他发现用户们在用它做各种非编码的工作——做度假研究、做 PPT、清理邮件、取消订阅、从硬盘恢复婚礼照片、监控植物生长，甚至控制烤箱。\n\n> Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven.\n>\n> https://t.co/vDTIR9c3xQ\n\n这些场景和写代码完全不沾边，但 Skills + bash 能力的组合让这一切成为可能。比如我自己就做了一些工作流，帮我采集信息、写作、写 PPT、画漫画、发布，极大提升效率。像发文章到公众号、X Article 这些，以前需要手动重复的操作，现在一个 Skill 就搞定了。\n\n2. Skills 可以相互调用，用自然语言编排工作流\n\n如果是单一的 skill，作用其实有限。但当你有多个 skills，并且 skills 还可以相互调用，那意味着你可以编排工作流。\n\nSkills 让 AI 可以像《黑客帝国》主角 Neo 那样瞬间学会新技能：“I know kung fu”。Claude 会根据任务自动加载需要的 Skill，完成后再卸载，整个过程无需用户干预。\n\n而最神奇的地方在于，你只需要用自然语言去编排工作流。这中间会有 Agent/大模型去解读你的自然语言，按照工作流执行，有问题还会帮你修复。这极大地解决了非专业用户需要程序员协助编排工作流的问题。\n\n3. Skills 本身易于分发，几乎成了每个 agent 的标配\n\n一个 skill 只要有一个 https://t.co/05rGqABuRg markdown 文件和辅助的脚本或者文档，打个 zip 包就能发布。这种轻量级的设计让分发变得极其简单。\n\n有个时间点很重要，2025 年 12 月 18 日，Anthropic 宣布将 Agent Skills 规范开放为跨平台标准。很快，微软在 VS Code 和 GitHub Copilot 中集成了对 Agent Skills 的支持，OpenAI 也在 ChatGPT 的代码解释器和 Codex CLI 中采用了几乎相同的技能目录结构。\n\nSkills 在 10 月发布时，主要还是被定位为开发者工具。但随着生态成熟、开放标准确立、以及 Cowork 这样面向普通用户的产品推出，Skills 在非编程领域的价值才真正被释放出来。\n\n回顾这个过程：\n10 月：Skills 发布，开发者圈小范围关注\n11-12 月：技能规范开放、生态扩展、用户积累经验\n1 月：产品更新 + 非编程场景落地 + 病毒式传播 = 爆发\n\nSkills 的爆发是现在它找到了真正的价值定位，让非程序员也能通过自然语言编排复杂的自动化工作流。这才是 Skills 真正火起来的原因，随着更多场景被发掘出来，还会持续的火上一段时间。",

        "text": "Jonathan Ross, Founder and CEO of AI chip company Groq, offers a contrarian view: AI won't destroy jobs, it will create a labour shortage.\n\nHe outlines three things that will happen because of AI:\n\nFirst, massive deflationary pressure.\n\n\"This cup of coffee is going to cost less. Your housing is going to cost less. Everything is going to cost less.\"\n\nHe explains this will happen through robots farming coffee more efficiently and better supply chain management, meaning people will need less money.\n\nSecond, people will opt out of the economy.\n\n\"They're going to work fewer hours. They're going to work fewer days a week, and they're going to work fewer years. They're going to retire earlier because they're going to be able to support their lifestyle working less.\"\n\nThird, entirely new jobs and industries will emerge.\n\nJonathan points to history as evidence:\n\n\"Think about 100 years ago. 98% of the workforce in the United States was in agriculture. When we were able to reduce that to 2%, we found things for those other 98% of the population to do.\"\n\nHe continues:\n\n\"The jobs that are going to exist 100 years from now, we can't even contemplate.\"\n\nSoftware developers didn't exist a century ago. In another century, they won't exist either, \"because everyone's going to be vibe coding.\"\n\nThe same applies to influencers, a career that would have been unthinkable 100 years ago but now earns people millions.\n\nHis conclusion: deflationary pressure, workforce opt-outs, and new industries we can't yet imagine will combine to create one outcome...\n\n\"We're not going to have enough people.\"",

Similarly, Jacob Blake, the most famous BLM case after Floyd and Brown, was a rapist who fought cops with a hunting knife on him while trying to steal a car full of kids.\n\n Hard to feel anything close to full sympathy.",

We're far from the rest of the world. \n\nOur State Sponsored Media tells you that Australia has the best of everything in the world. That our culture and lifestyle is unmatched.\n\nBut as soon as you arrive in America it is blindingly obvious how false that is. America feels explosive, alive, chaotic, rich. It's loud, obnoxious, unapologetic.\n\nThere's no hint of tall poppy syndrome. And no constant nagging of the Nanny State. \n\nAmerica is accelerating into an unknown future without fear. \n\nThere are so many technological innovations here that would never see the light of day in Australia, because they would be strangled by regulation.\n\nAustralia is beautiful, sure. But it's safe, quiet, controlled. \n\nMedia and society tell you to conform, comply, be seen and not heard. Take the safe option. Be fearful of new things. Be fearful of the future.\n\nThe spark of innovation is stifled. The light of creativity is discouraged. The warmth of the collective is more important than the rugged individual.\n\nAnd as time goes on, one of the two countries is going to be left behind. It's pretty clear which country that is.\n\nSo, it's terrifying. \n\nAnd before I came here, everyone said I should be terrified of America. That I wouldn't be let it the country. That everyone is rioting. That Hitler runs the country. \n\nThat couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nTheir brains have been absolutely fried by Australian State Sponsored media.",

        "text": "Here is Grok’s answer to your challenge @CathyYoung63 \n\nWhat percentage of people arrested by ICE agents are illegal aliens and what percentage are innocent citizens?\n\nGrok:\nAccording to data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and independent tracking by organizations like the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) and media outlets, ICE arrests overwhelmingly target non-citizens with immigration violations—commonly referred to as illegal aliens or undocumented immigrants. Reports indicate that over 328,000 people were arrested by ICE from January to mid-December 2025.\n\nWrongful arrests of U.S. citizens (who could be considered \"innocent\" in this context, as they are not subject to immigration enforcement) are rare but documented. Investigations have identified more than 170 confirmed cases of U.S. citizens being held by ICE agents in 2025, often due to errors in questioning citizenship status.\n\nOther sources report up to 674 arrests of individuals claiming or confirmed as U.S. citizens during the same period, though only about 121 were detained beyond initial arrest.\n\nUsing the higher estimate of 674 wrongful arrests out of approximately 328,000 total ICE arrests in 2025, this represents about 0.2% of arrests. The lower confirmed figure of 170 cases equates to roughly 0.05%. In either case, the percentage of \"innocent people\" (U.S. citizens wrongly arrested) is under 1%, while approximately 99.8-99.95% are non-citizens with immigration violations (illegal aliens). Note that ICE prioritizes arrests of non-citizens with criminal convictions or charges (about 70% of arrests), but the remaining 30% are typically non-criminal immigration violators—still classified as illegal aliens under U.S. law.",

      "text": "继续吃瓜，根据The Information的报道：\n\n对于 Thinking Machines Lab 来说，这个时机再尴尬不过了。\n\n周三，在这家 AI 初创公司的全体员工大会（All-hands meeting）上，其首席执行官 Mira Murati 宣布，她已解雇了 Thinking Machines 的联合创始人之一、首席技术官 Barret Zoph，原因是绩效不佳以及与竞争对手接触。据一位知情人士透露了上述消息。\n\n据该知情人士称，就在会议期间，另外两名 Thinking Machines 的研究员 Luke Metz 和 Sam Schoenholz 抛出了重磅炸弹，他们分别在公司 Slack 上发帖称自己要辞职。\n\n据该知情人士透露，Murati 对 Metz 和 Schoenholz 的消息似乎感到措手不及，而 Thinking Machines 的一些员工则被这接二连三爆出的三个离职消息惊呆了。\n\n当天晚些时候，OpenAI 高管 Fidji Simo 宣布她的公司已聘用了这三名研究员（他们此前都曾在 OpenAI 工作，后来跳槽到 Thinking Machines），员工们的不安情绪开始加剧。\n\n到了周四，又有两名 Thinking Machines 的员工——研究员 Lia Guy 和工程师 Ian O’Connell——告诉同事他们也要离开公司。在五名离职者中，有四人加入了 OpenAI。\n\n通常情况下，大约 5% 的员工离职——Thinking Machines 在本周这波“叛逃”之前雇佣了大约 100 人——并不一定会引起严重担忧。但这些离职人员中包括该公司六位联合创始人中的两位，而且在此之前，第三位联合创始人 Andrew Tulloch 已于秋季离职去了 Meta Platforms。\n\n据部分投资者称，这些事件让 Thinking Machines 的投资者感到不安。这家成立仅一年的初创公司目前只发布了一款产品，它正在进行一轮雄心勃勃的融资，旨在使公司估值达到 500 亿美元——这是其上一轮估值的五倍多。这些变动可能会使这一融资难以完成。",

All foreign invasions, from the Huns to the Ottomans to the Moors, were ultimately repelled.\n\nToday, within just a few decades, this chain is being broken. The people living in huge parts of Europe, France, Germany, England, and Italy in 100 years will not be the descendants of those who lived there 100 years earlier.\n\nThis has never happened in the last 5,000 years.\n\nSo forgive me if I don’t care whether someone calls me racist or whether a leftist judge claims we should be banned.\n\nFar more is at stake than a delusional anti-white universalism. That ideology is only a few decades old and will fade away.\n\nWhat must endure is resistance to this threat. Every people deserves an identity, a culture, and a homeland. I want to take nothing from anyone. I simply want to live this life and pass it on.\n\nIf you think that makes me evil, then that makes you evil.",

        "text": "BREAKING 🚨 TESLA HAS PATENTED A \"MATHEMATICAL CHEAT CODE\" THAT FORCES CHEAP 8-BIT CHIPS TO RUN ELITE 32-BIT AI MODELS AND REWRITES THE RULES OF SILICON 🐳 \n\nHow does a Tesla remember a stop sign it hasn’t seen for 30 seconds, or a humanoid robot maintain perfect balance while carrying a heavy, shifting box?\n\nIt comes down to Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE)—the \"GPS of the mind\" that allows AI to understand its place in space and time by assigning a unique rotational angle to every piece of data.\n\nUsually, this math is a hardware killer. To keep these angles from \"drifting\" into chaos, you need power-hungry, high-heat 32-bit processors (chips that calculate with extreme decimal-point precision).\n\nBut Tesla has engineered a way to cheat the laws of physics. Freshly revealed in patent US20260017019A1, Tesla’s \"MIXED-PRECISION BRIDGE\" is a mathematical translator that allows inexpensive, power-sipping 8-bit hardware (which usually handles only simple, rounded numbers) to perform elite 32-bit rotations without dropping a single coordinate.\n\nThis breakthrough is the secret \"Silicon Bridge\" that gives Optimus and FSD high-end intelligence without sacrificing a mile of range or melting their internal circuits. It effectively turns Tesla’s efficient \"budget\" hardware into a high-fidelity supercomputer on wheels.\n\n📉 The problem: the high cost of precision\n\nIn the world of self-driving cars and humanoid robots, we are constantly fighting a war between precision and power. Modern AI models like Transformers rely on RoPE to help the AI understand where objects are in a sequence or a 3D space.\n\nThe catch is that these trigonometric functions (sines and cosines) usually require 32-bit floating-point math—imagine trying to calculate a flight path using 10 decimal places of accuracy.\n\nIf you try to cram that into the standard 8-bit multipliers (INT8) used for speed (which is like rounding everything to the nearest whole number), the errors pile up fast. The car effectively goes blind to fine details.\n\nFor a robot like Optimus, a tiny math error means losing its balance or miscalculating the distance to a fragile object. To bridge this gap without simply adding more expensive chips, Tesla had to fundamentally rethink how data travels through the silicon.\n\n🛠️ Tesla's solution: the logarithmic shortcut & pre-computation\n\nTesla’s engineers realized they didn't need to force the whole pipeline to be high-precision. Instead, they designed the Mixed-Precision Bridge.\n\nThey take the crucial angles used for positioning and convert them into logarithms. Because the \"dynamic range\" of a logarithm is much smaller than the original number, it’s much easier to move that data through narrow 8-bit hardware without losing the \"soul\" of the information.\n\nIt’s a bit like dehydrating food for transport; it takes up less space and is easier to handle, but you can perfectly reconstitute it later.\n\nCrucially, the patent reveals that the system doesn't calculate these logarithms on the fly every time. Instead, it retrieves pre-computed logarithmic values from a specialized \"cheat sheet\" (look-up storage) to save cycles.\n\nBy keeping the data in this \"dehydrated\" log-state, Tesla ensures that the precision doesn't \"leak out\" during the journey from the memory chips to the actual compute cores. However, keeping data in a log-state is only half the battle; the chip eventually needs to understand the real numbers again.\n\n🏗️ The recovery architecture: rotation matrices & Horner’s method\n\nWhen the 8-bit multiplier (the Multiplier-Accumulator or MAC) finishes its job, the data is still in a \"dehydrated\" logarithmic state. To bring it back to a real angle theta without a massive computational cost, Tesla’s high-precision ALU uses a Taylor-series expansion optimized via Horner’s Method.\n\nThis is a classic computer science trick where a complex equation (like an exponent) is broken down into a simple chain of multiplications and additions.\n\nBy running this in three specific stages—multiplying by constants like 1/3 and 1/2 at each step—Tesla can approximate the exact value of an angle with 32-bit accuracy while using a fraction of the clock cycles.\n\nOnce the angle is recovered, the high-precision logic generates a Rotation Matrix (a grid of sine and cosine values) that locks the data points into their correct 3D coordinates.\n\nThis computational efficiency is impressive, but Tesla didn't stop at just calculating faster; they also found a way to double the \"highway speed\" of the data itself.\n\n🧩 The data concatenation: 8-bit inputs to 16-bit outputs\n\nOne of the most clever hardware \"hacks\" detailed in the patent is how Tesla manages to move 16-bit precision through an 8-bit bus. They use the MAC as a high-speed interleaver—effectively a \"traffic cop\" that merges two lanes of data.\n\nIt takes two 8-bit values (say, an X-coordinate and the first half of a logarithm) and multiplies one of them by a power of two to \"left-shift\" it.\n\nThis effectively glues them together into a single 16-bit word in the output register, allowing the low-precision domain to act as a high-speed packer for the high-precision ALU to \"unpack\".\n\nThis trick effectively doubles the bandwidth of the existing wiring on the chip without requiring a physical hardware redesign. With this high-speed data highway in place, the system can finally tackle one of the biggest challenges in autonomous AI: object permanence.\n\n🧠 Long-context memory: remembering the stop sign\n\nThe ultimate goal of this high-precision math is to solve the \"forgetting\" problem. In previous versions of FSD, a car might see a stop sign, but if a truck blocked its view for 5 seconds, it might \"forget\" the sign existed.\n\nTesla uses a \"long-context\" window, allowing the AI to look back at data from 30 seconds ago or more.\n\nHowever, as the \"distance\" in time increases, standard positional math usually drifts. Tesla's mixed-precision pipeline fixes this by maintaining high positional resolution, ensuring the AI knows exactly where that occluded stop sign is even after a long period of movement.\n\nThe RoPE rotations are so precise that the sign stays \"pinned\" to its 3D coordinate in the car's mental map. But remembering 30 seconds of high-fidelity video creates a massive storage bottleneck.\n\n⚡ KV-cache optimization & paged attention: scaling memory\n\nTo make these 30-second memories usable in real-time without running out of RAM, Tesla optimizes the KV-cache (Key-Value Cache)—the AI's \"working memory\" scratchpad.\n\nTesla’s hardware handles this by storing the logarithm of the positions directly in the cache. This reduces the memory footprint by 50% or more, allowing Tesla to store twice as much \"history\" (up to 128k tokens) in the same amount of RAM.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla utilizes Paged Attention—a trick borrowed from operating systems. Instead of reserving one massive, continuous block of memory (which is inefficient), it breaks memory into small \"pages\".\n\nThis allows the AI5 chip to dynamically allocate space only where it's needed, drastically increasing the number of objects (pedestrians, cars, signs) the car can track simultaneously without the system lagging.\n\nYet, even with infinite storage efficiency, the AI's attention mechanism has a flaw: it tends to crash when pushed beyond its training limits.\n\n🔒 Pipeline integrity: the \"read-only\" safety lock\n\nA subtle but critical detail in the patent is how Tesla protects this data. Once the transformed coordinates are generated, they are stored in a specific location that is read-accessible to downstream components but not write-accessible by them.\n\nFurthermore, the high-precision ALU itself cannot read back from this location.\n\nThis one-way \"airlock\" prevents the system from accidentally overwriting its own past memories or creating feedback loops that could cause the AI to hallucinate. It ensures that the \"truth\" of the car's position flows in only one direction: forward, toward the decision-making engine.\n\n🌀 Attention sinks: preventing memory overflow\n\nEven with a lean KV-cache, a robot operating for hours can't remember everything forever. Tesla manages this using Attention Sink tokens.\n\nTransformers tend to dump \"excess\" attention math onto the very first tokens of a sequence, so if Tesla simply used a \"sliding window\" that deleted old memories, the AI would lose these \"sink\" tokens and its brain would effectively crash.\n\nTesla's hardware is designed to \"pin\" these attention sinks permanently in the KV-cache. By keeping these mathematical anchors stable while the rest of the memory window slides forward, Tesla prevents the robot’s neural network from destabilizing during long, multi-hour work shifts.\n\nWhile attention sinks stabilize the \"memory\", the \"compute\" side has its own inefficiencies—specifically, wasting power on empty space.\n\n🌫️ Sparse tensors: cutting the compute fat\n\nTesla’s custom silicon doesn't just cheat with precision; it cheats with volume. In the real world, most of what a car or robot sees is \"empty\" space (like clear sky).\n\nIn AI math, these are represented as \"zeros\" in a Sparse Tensor (a data structure that ignores empty space). Standard chips waste power multiplying all those zeros, but Tesla’s newest architecture incorporates Native Sparse Acceleration.\n\nThe hardware uses a \"coordinate-based\" system where it only stores the non-zero values and their specific locations. The chip can then skip the \"dead space\" entirely and focus only on the data that matters—the actual cars and obstacles.\n\nThis hardware-level sparsity support effectively doubles the throughput of the AI5 chip while significantly lowering the energy consumed per operation.\n\n🔊 The audio edge: Log-Sum-Exp for sirens\n\nTesla’s \"Silicon Bridge\" isn't just for vision—it's also why your Tesla is becoming a world-class listener. To navigate safely, an autonomous vehicle needs to identify emergency sirens and the sound of nearby collisions using a Log-Mel Spectrogram approach (a visual \"heat map\" of sound frequencies).\n\nThe patent details a specific Log-Sum-Exp (LSE) approximation technique to handle this. By staying in the logarithm domain, the system can handle the massive \"dynamic range\" of sound—from a faint hum to a piercing fire truck—using only 8-bit hardware without \"clipping\" the loud sounds or losing the quiet ones.\n\nThis allows the car to \"hear\" and categorize environmental sounds with 32-bit clarity. Of course, all this high-tech hardware is only as good as the brain that runs on it, which is why Tesla's training process is just as specialized.\n\n🎓 Quantization-aware training: pre-adapting the brain\n\nFinally, to make sure this \"Mixed-Precision Bridge\" works flawlessly, Tesla uses Quantization-Aware Training (QAT).\n\nInstead of training the AI in a perfect 32-bit world and then \"shrinking\" it later—which typically causes the AI to become \"drunk\" and inaccurate—Tesla trains the model from day one to expect 8-bit limitations.\n\nThey simulate the rounding errors and \"noise\" of the hardware during the training phase, creating a neural network that is \"pre-hardened\". It’s like a pilot training in a flight simulator that perfectly mimics a storm; when they actually hit the real weather in the real world, the AI doesn’t \"drift\" or become inaccurate because it was born in that environment.\n\nThis extreme optimization opens the door to running Tesla's AI on devices far smaller than a car.\n\n🚀 The strategic roadmap: from AI5 to ubiquitous edge AI\n\nThis patent is not just a \"nice-to-have\" optimization; it is the mathematical prerequisite for Tesla’s entire hardware roadmap. Without this \"Mixed-Precision Bridge\", the thermal and power equations for next-generation autonomy simply do not work.\n\nIt starts by unlocking the AI5 chip, which is projected to be 40x more powerful than current hardware. Raw power is useless if memory bandwidth acts as a bottleneck.\n\nBy compressing 32-bit rotational data into dense, log-space 8-bit packets, this patent effectively quadruples the effective bandwidth, allowing the chip to utilize its massive matrix-compute arrays without stalling.\n\nThis efficiency is critical for the chip's \"half-reticle\" design, which reduces silicon size to maximize manufacturing yield while maintaining supercomputer-level throughput.\n\nThis efficiency is even more critical for Tesla Optimus, where it is a matter of operational survival. The robot runs on a 2.3 kWh battery (roughly 1/30th of a Model 3 pack).\n\nStandard 32-bit GPU compute would drain this capacity in under 4 hours, consuming 500W+ just for \"thinking\".\n\nBy offloading complex RoPE math to this hybrid logic, Tesla slashes the compute power budget to under 100W. This solves the \"thermal wall\", ensuring the robot can maintain balance and awareness for a full 8-hour work shift without overheating.\n\nThis stability directly enables the shift to End-to-End Neural Networks. The \"Rotation Matrix\" correction described in the patent prevents the mathematical \"drift\" that usually plagues long-context tracking.\n\nThis ensures that a stop sign seen 30 seconds ago remains \"pinned\" to its correct 3D coordinate in the World Model, rather than floating away due to rounding errors.\n\nFinally, baking this math into the silicon secures Tesla's strategic independence. It decouples the company from NVIDIA’s CUDA ecosystem and enables a Dual-Foundry Strategy with both Samsung and TSMC to mitigate supply chain risks.\n\nThis creates a deliberate \"oversupply\" of compute, potentially turning its idle fleet and unsold chips into a distributed inference cloud that rivals AWS in efficiency.\n\nBut the roadmap goes further. Because this mixed-precision architecture slashes power consumption by orders of magnitude, it creates a blueprint for \"Tesla AI on everything\".\n\nIt opens the door to porting world-class vision models to hardware as small as a smart home hub or smartphone. This would allow tiny, cool-running chips to calculate 3D spatial positioning with zero latency—bringing supercomputer-level intelligence to the edge without ever sending private data to a massive cloud server.",

        "text": "Claude 的新功能 Cowork：让 AI 真正帮你干活\n\nClaude Code 本来是给程序员写代码用的，结果大家发现它整理文件、做表格、写报告也很顺手。Anthropic 索性把这套能力包装成了 Cowork，让不会写代码的人也能用上。\n\n【1】Cowork 到底能干啥\n\n你选一个电脑上的文件夹，Claude 就能在里面读文件、改文件、创建新文件。\n\n听起来简单，用起来挺香。比如你下载文件夹乱成一锅粥，让它帮你分类重命名。或者你有一堆消费截图，它能整理成一张 Excel 表。再比如你写了几页凌乱的笔记，它能帮你理顺思路、输出初稿。\n\n和普通对话不一样的是，Cowork 模式下 Claude 更像个真正的助手。你布置任务，它自己规划步骤、一步步执行，中间会告诉你进度。如果你用过 Claude Code，这感觉会很熟悉，因为底层技术是同一套。\n\n【2】还能更强\n\n基础功能只是起点。Cowork 可以接上你已有的连接器，比如 Google Drive、Slack。它还内置了一批技能，能更好地生成文档、PPT 之类的文件。再配上 Chrome 浏览器插件，Claude 甚至能帮你操作网页。\n\n这套设计让工作流变得很丝滑。你不用反复给 Claude 喂上下文，也不用手动把输出转成正确格式。甚至不用等它做完一件事再布置下一件，可以连续丢任务让它并行处理。用 Anthropic 的话说，这感觉不像你一句我一句地聊天，更像给同事留便签。\n\n【3】和 Claude Code 共享技能生态\n\n对 Claude Code 用户来说有个好消息：Cowork 能读取你本地的 https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu 文件和自定义 Skills。\n\n我测试了一下，选择工作文件夹后，Cowork 能看到里面的 https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu 并按指令执行。我在 Claude Code 里配置的写作风格技能，Cowork 里也能直接调用。技能分两类：Anthropic 官方提供的（docx、pptx、pdf 这些）和用户自己创建的，两类都能用。\n\n换句话说，你在 Claude Code 里攒下的工作流配置可以直接迁移过来。Cowork 不是另起炉灶，是同一套体系的图形化入口。\n\n有个坑要注意：Cowork 跑在 Linux 虚拟机里，而你的 Mac 是 ARM 架构。如果技能依赖 node_modules 或本地特定环境（比如浏览器 cookies、特定架构的二进制文件），就跑不了。我试着调用一个需要运行 nodejs 脚本的图片生成技能，报错了——架构不兼容。纯文本类的配置（https://t.co/k5gfrsJiDu、写作规范）没问题，涉及本地脚本的技能可能需要额外适配。\n\n【4】安全边界在哪里\n\nClaude 只能访问你明确授权的文件夹和连接器，动作比较大的时候会先问你。但有几件事得提前知道：Claude 可能会误解你的指令，如果你说\"清理一下这个文件夹\"，它可能真的把文件删了。指令要说清楚。\n\n另一个风险是提示词注入，就是攻击者在网页内容里藏一些指令，试图劫持 Claude 的行为。Anthropic 说他们做了防护，但这个领域整个行业都还在摸索。\n\n这些风险不是 Cowork 特有的，只是很多人可能是第一次用这种更自主的 AI 工具。官方建议：刚开始用的时候谨慎点，别一上来就让它处理重要文件。\n\n【5】现在能用吗\n\nCowork 目前是研究预览版，只对 Mac 上的 Claude Max 订阅用户开放。Anthropic 想先看看大家怎么用、有什么反馈，然后快速迭代。后面会加跨设备同步，也会出 Windows 版。\n\n这一步到是意料之中，因为 Claude Code 现在已经被用在很多编程意外的领域，但是门槛略高，限制了使用群体是程序员或者懂点技术的用户，而且脚本执行权限会有很多安全上的隐患。Cowork 一下子降低了使用的门槛，通过图形化界面就可以操作，并且也让使用更安全。\n\n现在还是早期版本，能做的事有限，安全机制也在完善中。但如果你是 Max + Mac 用户，值得一试。",

Hundreds of \"middleman\" firms act as payroll agents with almost zero oversight.\n\nIt's basically a government ATM if you know how to game it.\n\nThey're forking over $1M, facing 10 years max. That's $68M stolen, $1M returned. Math works if you don't get caught.\n\nSource: DOJ, New York Post",
