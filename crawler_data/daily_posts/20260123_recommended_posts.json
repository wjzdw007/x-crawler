At no point did I need to disengage FSD or question the system enough to take over the steering wheel. @Tesla FSD is a smooth and cautious driver.\n\nThere were a few highlights. One was when FSD was cautious around pedestrians on Berkeley's campus. I recall a student who wasn't using the crosswalk but was close to it, walking across the road. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation.\n\nThe system also managed to navigate the university's roads and perform a three-point turn when I stopped the car and added a new destination.\"",

Scholarly Credibility\n\n∙Eisen’s Brookings affiliation provides academic veneer\n\n∙Papers cited by plaintiffs give appearance of neutral scholarly consensus\n\n∙Contrast with Elias, who’s openly partisan operative\n\nThe Funding Question\n\nTotal spending by Eisen-affiliated organizations (2025 fiscal year):\n\n∙States United Democracy Center: $32.4M\n∙CREW: $28.7M\n∙Protect Democracy: $24.1M\n∙Democracy Forward: $15.8M\n∙Combined: $101 million\n\nThis doesn’t include:\n∙Outside law firms working pro bono or reduced rates\n∙Individual donor funding of specific cases\n∙Dark money pass-throughs (Sixteen Thirty Fund, others)\nWhere money comes from (aggregated from tax filings):\n\nMajor Foundation Support:\n∙Open Society Foundations (Soros): ~$12M across orgs\n∙Wyss Foundation: ~$8M\n∙Democracy Fund: ~$6M\n∙Sixteen Thirty Fund: ~$15M (itself funded by undisclosed donors)\n\nIndividual Mega-Donors (disclosed contributions >$100k):\n∙Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn founder): ~$4M\n∙Laurene Powell Jobs (Steve Jobs widow): ~$3M\n∙Pierre Omidyar (eBay founder): ~$2M\n∙Dustin Moskovitz (Facebook co-founder): ~$2M\n\nA bunch of billionaires control everything that’s going on because they file a lawsuit every single time Trump does something. I guarantee you this is not how our founding fathers envisioned our country to operate and the only reason is possible is because of NGOs.",

That talking point is based on studies that use extrapolations to estimate totals. They avoid looking at the actual demographics of state and federal prisons because the data does not support the narrative they want to push.\n\nIn 2018 the Department of Homeland Security released a study that showed 1 in 5 inmates in the federal prison system were illegal immigrants. The study also showed that illegal immigrants in Arizona were twice as likely to commit crimes (not including the crime of coming here illegally) than American citizens. It's very strange that our elected officials like to push narratives that disparage their own people.",

Just the other day my grandmother fell and broke her hip. She lives by herself about an hour drive from me, so it's difficult to be there all the time. She was found on the floor laying for 5 hours. The only way we knew something was wrong was because she wasn't answering the phone, we had to drive an hour to see what happened. She refuses a caregiver who lives in the neighborhood to come in and check in on her, she insists that she doesn't need help. Optimus would be a huge lifesaver for her. She can still maintain her independence and have Optimus there to help her when she needs it. Optimus can adjust its help based on her personality and observing what she needs help with so she can still feel independent and active without all the dangers that come with being nearly 90 years old.",

        "text": "Ming is out with another explanation of a Tesla AI patent. IMHO, the innovations outlined here are on par with the Attention Is All You Need paper when it comes to running sophisticated AI algorithms quickly and efficiently.\n\nTesla had to be doing something incredibly efficient to be able to simultaneously process 6 video streams to drive a car on the underpowered HW3 chip that came out in 2019. The innovations described here were first described in a provisional patent filed in 2018.\n\nNeural net AI algorithms were conceived by very brainy researchers which used mathematical proofs to show how multiple layers of floating point numbers could be combined to learn things. And by floating point, I mean numbers from -1 to 1, like 0.45534. \n\nGPUs that were used to draw video game screens were also really good at computing floating point math. So by a quirk of history, when AI researchers in 2012 looked around to see what they could use to compute these floating point operations, they found these GPUs.\n\nBut when Tesla took on the challenge of a self driving car, they realized high powered GPUs (which even in 2018 were being assembled into giant supercomputers with thousands of chips to compute AI workloads) weren't going to fit inside a car's energy and power budget. \n\nComputing floating point math is way slower than working with small 8 bit integers, which can represent integers (no decimals) from -127 to 127, which is only 255 unique numbers, a far cry the millions of unique numbers that \"normal\" AI algorithms use.\n\nThrough a lot of trial and error, Tesla came up with modifications to the \"normal\" vision processing AI algorithms to work well with such a limited number set. They trained many different models with different ways of using the limited number set and found which ways work and which ones didn't work. \n\nThe result is this patent. \n\nBtw, one of the reasons why the academic community looks down upon Tesla is that they don't publish academic papers like Google/Waymo does. Apparently for Tesla, you have to scour patents to see their secret sauce.",

          "text": "BREAKING 🚨 TESLA PATENTED \"STARNET\" TO SHOW THE WORLD HOW IT SQUEEZES SERVER-GRADE AI INTO $5 CHIPS 🐳\n\nDeep neural networks have a dirty secret: they are mathematically expensive.\n\nTo see the world clearly, AI models typically crave the high-precision, energy-guzzling power of massive GPUs. But for a robot to be nimble or a car to be truly autonomous, it needs that same server-grade intelligence running on cheap, battery-sipping microchips.\n\nThis constraint usually forces engineers to choose between being \"smart\" or being \"efficient\".\n\nTesla just refused to choose.\n\nAccording to patent US 2025/0292088 A1, Tesla has developed a new neural architecture called \"StarNet\" that fundamentally rewrites the rules of low-power computing.\n\nInstead of dumbing down the AI to fit on a simple chip, StarNet uses a novel \"mathematical cage\" to force complex deep learning to run safely on constrained 8-bit processors. These simple chips can typically only handle small, integer numbers.\n\nThis is the blueprint for how Tesla plans to embed high-level decision-making into every joint of a robot and every sensor of a car. It unlocks a future where sophisticated AI lives on the edge, not in the cloud.\n\nBut to understand why this is such a breakthrough, we first need to understand the mathematical wall that has stopped everyone else.\n\n⚖️ The problem: The heavy burden of floating-point arithmetic\n\nThe central challenge in deploying artificial intelligence to \"edge\" devices—like sensors in a car, components of a robot, or smart home appliances—is that these devices typically lack the computing power of a massive server farm.\n\nTraditional deep neural networks rely on high-precision mathematics, specifically 32-bit floating-point arithmetic, to process images and data accurately. This format allows computers to handle an enormous range of numbers with extreme precision, similar to using a scientific calculator that can calculate out to dozens of decimal places.\n\nHowever, this requires expensive, power-hungry processors that are not feasible for every small component in a vehicle or robot.\n\nWhen engineers try to run these networks on cheaper, low-power chips that use simpler 8-bit integer arithmetic, they run into a critical mathematical wall. The simplified processors often use \"signed\" integers where the maximum value is very low, specifically 127.\n\nThink of this limit like a small odometer on a bicycle that can only count up to 127 meters. When a neural network tries to add up thousands of calculations from a filter, the numbers often exceed this limit, causing an \"overflow\".\n\nWhen an overflow happens, the odometer doesn't just stop. It wraps around to a negative number, producing a wildly incorrect result that effectively breaks the AI's ability to recognize objects or process data.\n\nTo overcome this hardware limitation without crashing the system, Tesla had to reinvent the neural network from the ground up.\n\n✨ Tesla's solution: The StarNet Architecture\n\nTesla's solution is a novel neural network design dubbed \"StarNet\", explicitly engineered to operate within the strict confines of 8-bit arithmetic while preventing data overflows.\n\nTo understand the difference, imagine 32-bit floating-point math—the standard for modern AI—as a massive 12-lane highway. It has plenty of room for huge trucks (large numbers) and tiny motorcycles (small decimals) to travel side-by-side without ever touching the guardrails. This offers a massive \"numerical safety net\" where calculations can be sloppy or large without breaking the system.\n\nHowever, the inexpensive Digital Signal Processing (DSP) cores found in cars and robots are more like a narrow bike path. They often rely on non-saturating signed 8-bit integers, where the maximum representable value is a mere 127.\n\nIf a standard neural network tries to run on this hardware, it is like trying to drive a semi-truck down that bike path. The sum of its calculations would almost immediately exceed 127, causing an integer overflow. This results in garbage data, effectively crashing the vehicle's intelligence.\n\nSimply shrinking the network isn't enough; the fundamental topology—the architectural floor plan of how the neurons are wired together—must change.\n\nStarNet solves this by shifting the burden of precision. Instead of relying on the hardware to handle large numbers, the architecture itself is designed to remain \"numerically quiet\".\n\nThink of it like being in a library. If you can't build thicker walls (better hardware) to handle noise, you must enforce a strict \"whisper-only\" rule (StarNet). By intentionally keeping the internal numbers small so they never shout louder than \"127\", the system ensures it never hits that ceiling.\n\nIt achieves this through a ground-up redesign of how filters are shaped and how data flows. By enforcing a \"mathematically guaranteed safety\" protocol at the architectural level, StarNet allows Tesla to bypass the slow, power-hungry CPUs entirely.\n\nInstead, they can run sophisticated AI exclusively on highly efficient, specialized DSP cores. These cores are essentially simple, high-speed calculators that were previously thought to be too basic for deep learning.\n\nThis new architecture isn't random; it follows a very specific, recurring recipe designed to maximize efficiency.\n\n🏗️ The Blueprint: The \"Star-Shuffle\" recipe\n\nThe patent provides the exact recipe for the \"Star-Shuffle Block\", the atomic unit of this neural architecture. Tesla’s engineers found that a random arrangement of layers wouldn't work. Instead, they defined a strict recurring sequence: {1x1-conv, ReLU, Star-Conv, ReLU, Shuffle}. This specific order is critical, functioning like a highly efficient assembly line where every component has a non-negotiable role.\n\nThe process starts with a 1x1 convolution, which acts as the \"Mixer\". This step ignores the shape of the image and looks strictly at the \"depth\" of the data at a single point. It mixes the information across channels—like combining the Red, Green, and Blue data of a pixel into a single color concept, like Purple. This allows the network to combine raw inputs into complex features before passing them down the line.\n\nImmediately following this is the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function, the \"Gatekeeper\". Despite the complex name, it acts like a bouncer, filtering out irrelevant \"negative\" data. By blocking negative signals and only letting positive ones pass, it keeps the signal clean and introduces \"non-linearity\", the mathematical magic that allows AI to understand curves. Crucially, this filtering process also keeps the math simple enough for 8-bit hardware to handle efficiently.\n\nOnce the features are mixed and cleaned, the Star-Conv steps in as the \"Scanner\". It looks at the center pixel and its neighbors to understand shapes and edges. This is where the architecture's genius lies: by sandwiching this spatial processing between the channel mixing and the non-linear activations, the network maximizes its learning capability. It processes the \"what\" (color concepts) before the \"where\" (shapes), saving massive amounts of computing power.\n\nFinally, the block concludes with a Shuffle layer, the \"Networker\". Because the previous steps often split data into isolated groups to save energy, the network risks becoming \"siloed\". The Shuffle layer acts like a mandatory networking event, rearranging the channels to force information from different groups to mix. This ensures the left hand always knows what the right hand is doing, preventing the efficiency hacks from compromising the AI's intelligence.\n\nWhile this recipe sets the structure, the real efficiency gain comes from changing the shape of the filters themselves.\n\n🌟 The \"Star-Conv\": The carpool solution\n\nA standard convolutional neural network typically looks at the world through a square grid of 9 pixels. To understand an image, it has to combine the data from all 9 of these points at once.\n\nThink of this like trying to squeeze an entire baseball team (9 players) into a small 4-seater car (the low-power chip).\n\nIt simply doesn't fit. If you try to force everyone in, the car breaks down. In computing terms, adding up 9 separate numbers creates a total sum that is too \"heavy\" for the tiny chip to carry, causing the system to crash.\n\nTesla's patent introduces a solution called the \"star-shaped convolution\". Instead of a square, it uses a cross shape (+). It looks only at the center pixel and its four direct neighbors (Up, Down, Left, Right), ignoring the corners.\n\nThis reduces the group size from 9 players down to 5 (a basketball team).\n\nSuddenly, the team fits into the car. By leaving the 4 \"corner players\" behind, the total weight drops significantly, guaranteeing the car never breaks down.\n\nCrucially, this smaller team can still win the game. By focusing on the main directions (North, South, East, West), the AI can still recognize vertical lines, horizontal edges, and curves just as well as the larger group. It is like sketching a portrait using only 5 main strokes instead of 9—the picture is just as clear, but it takes much less effort to draw.\n\nBut geometry alone isn't enough; to truly guarantee safety, the system also needs to strictly manage the \"volume\" of the data itself.\n\n🔢 The \"(2+s)\" Math: Extreme bit-counting\n\nTo strictly prevent data overflows, the patent introduces a specific notation for \"bit-budgeting\", such as (2+s). This stands for \"2 bits of data plus 1 sign bit\".\n\nIn plain English, this forces the computer to work with tiny numbers. While a standard computer counts in millions, this system restricts variables to a maximum value of just 3.\n\nTo understand why this is necessary, imagine the microchip is a small room with glass windows. The \"sum\" of the calculations is the noise level in that room. The physical limit of the chip is 127 decibels. If the noise hits 128, the windows shatter and the system crashes.\n\nTo keep the windows intact, the patent outlines a sliding scale of \"volume control\" that changes based on how many \"voices\" (pixels) are speaking at once:\n\nFor a large 32-element filter: Think of this as a large choir of 32 singers. If everyone sings at the top of their lungs, the windows will definitely shatter. Therefore, the system enforces a strict \"whisper only\" rule. It limits the volume of the input (loudness) to a max of 3 and the weight (emphasis) to a max of 1. Even if all 32 singers whisper as loud as they are allowed, the total noise is 32 * 3 * 1 = 96. This is safely below the 127 limit, guaranteeing the glass won't break.\n\nFor a medium 16-element filter: This is like a small discussion group. Since there are fewer people, the strict whispering rule can be relaxed. The system allows the volume to go up to 7 (talking normally). The worst-case math becomes 16 * 7 * 1 = 112. It is louder, but still safely under the 127 limit, allowing the AI to be more precise with these details.\n\nFor a small 8-element filter: This is like a jazz quartet. With so few musicians, they have the freedom to play much louder. The system allows both the input volume and the instrument weight to go up to 3. The safety calculation is 8 * 3 * 3 = 72. This is well within the safe zone, proving that by strictly managing the \"volume\" of the data, Tesla can push the hardware to its absolute limit without ever risking a crash.\n\nTo ensure these tiny numbers still represent the real world accurately, the system uses a smart translation process.\n\n📉 Smart Quantization: The \"A\" and \"B\" formula\n\nTo make this low-bit math work without making the AI \"dumber\", StarNet employs a rigorous linear quantization strategy. It’s not enough to just \"round down\" numbers; the system must intelligently compress them.\n\nThe patent reveals that every single layer in the network is assigned two learnable parameters: A (scale) and B (bias).\n\nThe patent explicitly defines the relationship using a linear equation: the quantized value (V_Q) is calculated by taking the real-world value (V_R), dividing it by A, and then subtracting B. These parameters act like a precise conversion formula, similar to how you use a formula to translate temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n\nBut how does Tesla find the perfect A and B? The patent details a \"Calibration Phase\".\n\nBefore the neural network is ever deployed to a car or robot, a test dataset is passed through it one example at a time. The system records the absolute minimum and maximum output values for every specific layer.\n\nThese extremes are then plugged into a system of linear equations to solve for the precise A and B values that will fit that specific layer's data into the target bit-width (e.g., 0 to 3) without overflowing. This effectively creates a custom-fitted mathematical guardrail for every single neuron, ensuring that no matter what image the AI sees, the internal math will always remain safe and stable.\n\nOnce the parameters are set, Tesla applies one final trick to speed up the process even further.\n\n🧮 \"Quantization Collapsing\": The speed hack\n\nOne of the most granular innovations in the patent is a technique called \"Quantization Collapsing\".\n\nIn a standard low-bit network, the system is constantly stuck in a loop of conversion: de-quantizing the output of one layer back into a 'real' number, only to immediately re-quantize it for the next layer. This is like translating a sentence from English to French, and then immediately translating it back to English before moving on. This back-and-forth wastes valuable computing cycles.\n\nTesla’s solution is to mathematically fuse these adjacent steps.\n\nThe patent describes a mechanism where the de-quantization equation of one layer and the quantization equation of the next are collapsed into a single, pre-calculated operation. This reduces the computational load by a factor of two.\n\nEven more radically, the patent notes that for certain sequences, the system can \"leave out both of them\" entirely. This allows the network to run a chain of calculations using only an initial quantization at the start and a final dequantization at the end, effectively eliminating the computational middlemen and keeping the data in its fast, efficient 8-bit form.\n\nHowever, all this efficiency comes with a risk: the network can become too compartmentalized. The next component solves that.\n\n🔀 The Shuffle Layer: Breaking the silos\n\nOne side effect of using these highly efficient filters—specifically \"group convolutions\" where the group length is greater than 1—is that the network effectively splits into several independent, isolated mini-networks.\n\nThe patent notes that while the standard 1x1-conv layers can mix information between \"nearby\" channels, they cannot reach across to other groups. This means features learned in one part of the network are completely invisible to the rest, severely limiting intelligence. This is similar to different departments in a company refusing to talk to each other, preventing the organization from seeing the big picture.\n\nTo solve this, StarNet implements a \"shuffle\" layer at the end of every block.\n\nJust like shuffling a deck of cards, this operation takes the output data and strictly interleaves the channel ordering. The patent explicitly states that this enables communication across \"far-away channels\" that would otherwise remain isolated.\n\nBy forcing these independent groups to mix, the \"Star-Shuffle Block\" regains the representational power of a massive, fully connected network while retaining the extreme speed of a sparse, grouped one.\n\nWith the core architecture optimized, Tesla addresses the final hurdle: how to handle the very first glance at the world.\n\n🤝 Hybrid Processing: CPU and DSP teamwork\n\nFinally, the patent reveals a pragmatic \"hybrid\" hardware approach. While the goal is to use 8-bit arithmetic for speed, the inventors acknowledge that quantizing the very first input image too aggressively destroys accuracy immediately. You can't recover from bad data at the start.\n\nTo solve this, StarNet-A (an example architecture in the patent) creates a specific \"First Layer Exception\".\n\nThe very first layer—a Star-Conv with a stride of 2—is not run on the accelerator. Instead, it is computed on the device's general-purpose CPU using 16-bit arithmetic and 16-bit temporary storage.\n\nThis allows the system to ingest the raw, high-resolution RGB image and perform the initial feature extraction and downsampling, which is a process of shrinking the image size to make it easier to manage, with maximum precision.\n\nOnce this critical \"first impression\" is secure, the data is handed off to the specialized, high-efficiency DSP (Digital Signal Processor) cores for the remaining dozens of layers. This \"tag-team\" approach ensures the network starts with high-fidelity vision data before switching to ultra-low-power processing for the heavy lifting.\n\nSo, what does all this technical wizardry actually mean for Tesla's future?\n\n🚀 How this patent contributes to Tesla's now and future\n\nThis patent is the \"missing link\" that explains how Tesla plans to scale from smart cars to ubiquitous robotics. While the industry obsesses over massive GPUs in data centers, Tesla has quietly solved the opposite problem: how to put a \"brain\" into a dollar-store microchip.\n\nThe most immediate application is likely the technical foundation for the \"spinal cord\" of the Tesla Bot (Optimus). A humanoid robot cannot route every single twitch of a finger or balance correction of an ankle to a central computer in its chest—the latency, or delay, would be too high and the power drain too massive.\n\nStarNet allows Tesla to embed tiny, 8-bit neural networks directly into the local actuator controllers at each joint. This effectively gives Optimus a \"peripheral nervous system\", allowing hands and legs to handle their own reflex-level processing locally using simple DSPs, freeing up the central AI5 computer for high-level reasoning.\n\nThis distributed approach is equally critical for the upcoming Cybercab and Robotaxi fleet, where cost and redundancy are paramount. Redundancy here refers to having backup systems that ensure safety if the primary system fails.\n\nBy validating that high-accuracy vision can run on 8-bit DSPs, Tesla can install intelligent, redundant camera modules that process data before it even hits the main computer. If the main FSD computer were to glitch, these decentralized \"smart eyes\"—running unbreakable, overflow-proof StarNet code—could theoretically maintain enough visual awareness to pull the vehicle over safely.\n\nBeyond vehicles, this architecture enables a \"Smart Dust\" approach to the Alien Dreadnought factory. Tesla’s manufacturing strategy relies on extreme automation, and StarNet enables cheap sensors embedded in casting machines and stamping presses to detect defects or wear in real-time.\n\nBecause the architecture is designed for \"embedded devices\" with strict bit-budgets, these smart sensors can run on harvested energy or tiny batteries. This turns the entire Gigafactory into a living, sensing organism without requiring expensive server racks to process the data.\n\nUltimately, this innovation builds a massive economic moat based on pure efficiency.\n\nWhile competitors are building autonomous systems that rely on expensive, power-hungry NVIDIA Orin or Thor chips running heavy floating-point math, Tesla can achieve similar inference results using commodity 8-bit DSP hardware that costs a fraction of the price. Inference results is the technical term for the AI making a real-world decision based on what it sees.\n\nOver a fleet of millions of cars and robots, saving $100 per chip adds up to billions in profit, effectively weaponizing mathematical efficiency to scale intelligence faster and cheaper than anyone else.",

There'll be more robots than people. I think everyone on earth is going to have one humanoid robot because you would want a robot to watch over your kids, take care of your pet, take care of elderly parents. \n\nI'm very optimistic about the future.

And if that's the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished\n\nThe image in my mind is of a tiny candle in a vast darkness. A tiny candle of consciousness that could easily go out\n\nAnd that's why it's important to make life multi-planetary, such that if there is a natural disaster or a man-made disaster on Earth, that consciousness continues\n\nThat's the purpose of SpaceX\"",

No one has ever achieved full reusability of a rocket, which is very important for the cost of access to space.\n\nWe've achieved partial re usability with Falcon 9. We've now landed the boost stage over 500 times, but we have to throw away the upper stage. The upper stage burns up on reentry and the cost of that is equivalent to a small to medium sized jet.\n\nSo with Starship, which is a giant rocket, it's the largest flying machine ever made, we should prove full reusability, which will be a profound invention, because the cost of access to space will drop by a factor of 100 when you achieve full reusability. So it makes putting large satellites into space very low, very cheap.\"",

With its extremely thin atmosphere, Mars offers a sharper view of the cosmos, revealing more stars than we typically see from Earth\n\nMars is accompanied by two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. Phobos streaks across the sky in just a few hours, while Deimos moves slowly, resembling a faint drifting star\n\nThe Martian sky isn’t pure black. Dust in the atmosphere often gives it a subtle brownish hue, and near sunset, a soft blue glow can appear along the horizon. On especially clear nights, the Milky Way shines brightly, stretching across the sky in stunning detail",

Sanctuary states gaming the system by counting non-citizens for apportionment undermines the principle of \"one person, one vote\" for actual taxpayers. H.R.7109 - the Equal Representation Act - fixes this by mandating citizenship verification, ensuring congressional seats reflect legal voters rather than illegal entries.\n\nWhile some studies claim minimal impact, they ignore the compounding effect: every seat gained through demographic manipulation lets politicians redirect billions in federal funds to maintain their power base. California's 2.1 million undocumented residents didn't just \"happen\" to be there - they're the result of decades of deliberate non-enforcement.\n\nThe real cost? Law-abiding states lose infrastructure grants, healthcare resources, and political clout. This isn't about partisanship - it's about preventing foreign nationals from dictating America's legislative agenda through proxy representation. Fix the census, restore weight to citizens' votes.",

      "text": "Demis Hassabis 达沃斯访谈：比工业革命大 100 倍的变革\n视频地址：https://t.co/QCeqjHNM4Z\n\n2026 年 1 月，达沃斯世界经济论坛期间，Bloomberg 主持人 Emily Chang 采访了 Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis。这位诺贝尔奖得主用“每周 100 小时、每年 50 周”描述自己过去几年的工作状态，并给出了一个惊人的判断：AI 带来的变革将是工业革命的 10 倍规模、10 倍速度。\n\n这场访谈覆盖了 AI 领域几乎所有热门议题：AGI 时间线、中国竞争、机器人突破、就业冲击、是否应该暂停，以及后稀缺世界的哲学困境。以下是访谈的完整整理。\n\n---\n\n【1】Google 的势头回归\n\nEmily Chang 开门见山：Gemini 3 发布了，据说 OpenAI 内部宣布了“code red”——Google 是不是找回了状态？\n\n【编者注】Gemini 3 Pro 于 2025 年 11 月 18 日发布，是 Google 迄今最强的 AI 模型，在推理、多模态理解和编程能力上均有显著提升。12 月 17 日，Google 又推出了更快更便宜的 Gemini 3 Flash，直接替换 Gemini app 的默认模型。这一系列发布引发了 OpenAI 内部的紧张反应——三年前 ChatGPT 发布时，Google 内部也曾宣布过类似的“code red”。\n\nHassabis 回应说，过去一年确实是“非常艰苦的一年”，团队付出了巨大努力让模型重新回到最前沿。他特别提到 Gemini 3 和图像生成模型 Imagen 的表现让他们“非常满意”。\n\n“我们也适应了这个新世界——快速发布，把创业公司的能量带到我们所做的事情中。”\n\n当被问到外界是否低估了 Google 时，Hassabis 说他不确定，但 Google 一直具备所有必要的条件。“过去十年，Google 和 DeepMind 加在一起，发明了现代 AI 行业所依赖的大约 90% 的突破性技术。”他列举了 Transformer、AlphaGo、深度强化学习等例子。\n\n“我们有这些不可思议的产品触达数十亿用户——从搜索到邮箱到 Chrome——它们天然适合 AI。只是需要把这一切组织到一起。我们在过去几年做到了，虽然还有很多工作要做，但已经开始看到成果了。”\n\n---\n\n【2】全栈优势能维持多久？\n\nEmily Chang 追问：如果你认为自己有优势，这个优势有多大？能维持多久？\n\nHassabis 的回答很直接：一切从研究开始。模型的前沿水平是最重要的，这是 Google 和 DeepMind 合并后首先聚焦的方向。\n\n“我认为我们是唯一拥有完整技术栈的组织——从 TPU 和硬件、数据中心、云业务、前沿实验室，到所有这些天然适合 AI 的产品。从第一性原理来看，我们理应做得非常好。而且我认为未来还有很大的提升空间。”\n\n---\n\n【3】AI CEO 的日常：凌晨 1 点到 4 点的深度思考\n\nEmily Chang 说她读到 Hassabis 大部分深度思考都发生在凌晨 1 点到 4 点之间。他确认了这一点。\n\n“你有没有感到舒服过？”她问。\n\n“从来没有。”Hassabis 说，“过去三四年一直是难以置信的高强度。每周 100 小时，每年 50 周，这就是常态。”\n\n他认为这是处于“科技史上可能最激烈的竞争”前沿所必需的。“商业上、科学上，再加上所有关于 AGI 的兴奋……用 AI 加速科学发现一直是我的热情所在。这是我毕生的梦想，我为此工作了一辈子。很难入睡，因为有太多工作要做，同时又有太多激动人心的事情要探索和推进。”\n\n---\n\n【4】机器人：突破时刻还需要 18-24 个月\n\nEmily Chang 提到 Gemini 已经被集成到人形机器人中，问物理世界的“AlphaFold 时刻”是否已经到来。\n\n【编者注】2026 年 1 月 5 日，在 CES 展会上，Boston Dynamics、Google DeepMind 和 Hyundai 宣布了一项重大合作。Boston Dynamics 将把 DeepMind 的 Gemini Robotics 基础模型整合到其 Atlas 人形机器人中，首先应用于 Hyundai 的汽车制造工厂。这是 Google 2013 年收购又于 2017 年出售 Boston Dynamics 之后，双方的首次重要合作。\n\nHassabis 说他过去一年花了大量时间仔细研究机器人领域。“我确实认为我们正处于物理智能突破的临界点。但我仍然认为还需要大约 18 个月到 2 年的时间，需要做更多研究。”\n\n他解释说，Gemini 从一开始就被设计成多模态的，能够理解物理世界，原因之一是可以构建一个存在于眼镜或手机上的通用助手，理解你周围的世界；另一个用途就是机器人。\n\n“那么物理世界的突破时刻会是什么样子？我认为是机器人能够可靠地在现实世界中完成有用的任务。”\n\n他列举了几个阻碍因素。首先是算法还不够稳健，需要比 LLM 更少的数据就能工作。其次，也是让 Hassabis 感触最深的，是硬件问题——特别是机械手。\n\n“当你仔细研究机器人时，你会对人类的手产生一种全新的敬畏。进化设计得太精妙了。要匹配人手的可靠性、力量和灵巧性是非常困难的。”\n\n他提到了与 Boston Dynamics 和 Hyundai 的合作，将在汽车制造领域进行原型测试。“一两年后，我们可能会有一些真正令人印象深刻的展示，然后可以规模化部署。”\n\n---\n\n【5】中国与 DeepSeek：西方反应过度了\n\nEmily Chang 说，一年前 DeepSeek 的出现对西方来说似乎是灾难性的，但现在中国似乎安静了下来。Hassabis 对中国竞争的看法有变化吗？\n\nHassabis 的回答很坦率：“没有。我一开始就不认为那是灾难性的。我认为西方的反应是大规模过度反应（massive overreaction）。”\n\n他承认 DeepSeek 展示了中国公司的能力，但认为一些说法被夸大了。“关于他们使用的计算量非常少之类的说法被过度夸大了，因为他们依赖了一些西方模型，也在一些领先西方模型的输出上做了微调。所以这不是从零开始的。”\n\n他认为字节跳动可能是中国最有能力的 AI 公司，“可能只落后 6 个月，而不是一两年。”\n\n但 Hassabis 提出了一个关键问题：“到目前为止，中国公司能否超越前沿进行创新，这还有待观察。他们非常擅长追赶前沿，越来越有能力，但我认为他们还没有展示出能够超越前沿进行创新的能力。”\n\n---\n\n【6】AGI 时间线：2030 年 50% 概率，但标准比别人高\n\nEmily Chang 说 Hassabis 帮助定义了 AGI，并且曾表示 2030 年之前有 50% 的概率实现。这个时间线还成立吗？\n\n“是的。”他说。\n\n“AGI 对你来说还是一个有用的目标吗？”\n\nHassabis 说是的，虽然他的时间线比一些同行更长，但那是因为他的标准更高。“我说的是一个系统能够展现人类拥有的所有认知能力。我认为我们距离那还很远。”\n\n他举了科学创造力的例子：“不只是解决一个猜想或科学问题，而是能够首先提出假设或问题。任何科学家都知道，找到正确的问题往往比找到答案困难得多。”\n\n他明确表示当前系统“肯定还不具备这种能力”，未来会有，但不清楚还需要什么。\n\n他还提到了“持续学习”（continual learning）——系统需要能够在线学习，超越它们被训练的内容，在现实世界中即时学习。“在我看来，还有相当多的关键能力是缺失的。”\n\n---\n\n【7】AI 对就业的影响：比 Dario Amodei 乐观，但承认冲击终将到来\n\nEmily Chang 提到 Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei 当天早些时候在达沃斯说 AI 可能在 5 年内消灭 50% 的入门级白领工作。Hassabis 同意吗？\n\n【编者注】Dario Amodei 在 2025 年 5 月接受 Axios 采访时首次提出这一预测，随后在 60 Minutes 等多个场合重申。他表示 AI 可能导致失业率飙升至 10-20%，并呼吁政府和 AI 公司停止“粉饰”这一风险。\n\nHassabis 的回答明显更保守：“我的时间线会长得多。”\n\n他承认今年可能会开始看到一些迹象，比如入门级工作或实习的变化，但要实现真正的任务 Agent，需要解决当前 AI 的不一致性问题。\n\n“我称之为‘参差不齐的智能’（jagged intelligence）。当前系统在某些事情上非常好，在其他事情上非常差。如果你想把整个任务委托给一个 agent，而不是像今天这样只是辅助程序，你需要全面的一致性。”\n\n他给出了一个精辟的比喻：“如果它只在 95% 的任务上表现好是不够的。你需要它在整个任务上都表现好，才能真正做到‘发射后不管’。”\n\n但他也承认，这种颠覆终将到来。“在极限情况下，有了 AGI，我认为那会改变整个经济，远远超出就业问题。”\n\n他描绘了一个后稀缺世界的愿景：如果我们正确地构建它，我们将处于一个解决了一些世界根本问题的世界——比如能源。“如果我们用 AI 的帮助解决了聚变之类的问题，新材料……我认为在 AGI 之后 5 到 10 年，我们将处于一个极度富足的世界。那时经济和社会会是什么样子？”\n\n---\n\n【8】转型期的焦虑：10 倍规模、10 倍速度\n\nEmily Chang 说，在到达后稀缺世界之前——如果能到达的话——人们对中间发生的事情有很多焦虑。她提到自己是一位母亲，知道 Hassabis 也有孩子。“你最担心他们什么？你和他们谈些什么？”\n\nHassabis 承认这将是一个颠覆的时代，“就像工业革命一样。也许是 10 倍于工业革命，而且快 10 倍。”\n\nEmily Chang 迅速接话：“100 倍。”\n\n“是的，100 倍。”Hassabis 说，“但我也是人类创造力的坚定信仰者。我们极其适应性强，因为我们的心智是如此通用。你看看我们周围的现代世界——我们狩猎采集者的心智成功建造了现代文明。”\n\n他认为人类会再次适应，但这次的独特之处在于速度。“通常这样的转变需要一到两代人，但这次的速度和变革的规模都是前所未有的。”\n\n对于年轻人，他的建议是：“我会鼓励他们精通这些新工具，成为这些工具的原生用户。这几乎相当于给他们超能力。”\n\n他以创意艺术为例：“你可能能够做到过去需要 10 个人才能完成的工作。如果你有创业精神，在游戏设计、电影、项目方面有创意，你可能比过去更容易进入这些行业。”\n\n---\n\n【9】是否应该暂停？理想与现实\n\nEmily Chang 问：一些人主张暂停，给监管时间赶上，给社会时间适应。在一个完美的世界里，如果所有公司和国家都暂停，Hassabis 会支持吗？\n\n“我想是的。”他说。\n\n他提到这一直是他的梦想。“当我 15 年前创立 DeepMind、25 年前开始从事 AI 工作时，我的路线图是：当我们接近 AGI 这个门槛时刻时，我们可能会以科学的方式合作。”\n\n他描述了一个“AI 版 CERN”的愿景：世界上最优秀的人才聚集在一起，以非常严谨的科学方式完成最后的步骤。“不只是技术专家，还包括哲学家、社会科学家、经济学家，共同思考我们想从这项技术中得到什么，如何以造福全人类的方式利用它。”\n\n【编者注】CERN（欧洲核子研究中心）是全球最大的粒子物理学实验室，由 23 个成员国共同运营，是国际科学合作的典范。\n\n但他话锋一转：“不幸的是，这需要国际合作。即使一家公司、一个国家，甚至整个西方决定这样做，除非全世界至少在一些最低标准上达成一致，否则没有用。而现在国际合作有点棘手。”\n\nEmily Chang 追问：如果 AGI 在 2030 年到来，而监管还没有到位，我们是否注定会遇到困难？\n\nHassabis 说他仍然乐观，希望足够多的领先参与者能够沟通并合作，至少在安全和安保协议上。“我们已经与 Anthropic 等公司在这些方面进行了相当密切的合作。”\n\n当被问到是否愿意与 Sam Altman 合作时，Hassabis 说：“可能吧。我和几乎所有领先实验室的领导者关系都相当好。如果风险足够高——我认为每个人在未来 2 到 3 年会更清楚地认识到风险和代价。”\n\n---\n\n【10】Transformer 是死胡同吗？Hassabis 不同意\n\nEmily Chang 提到 Yann LeCun 说他不认为 Transformer 和 LLM 单独能让我们达到 AGI。\n\n【编者注】Yann LeCun 是图灵奖得主、Meta 前首席 AI 科学家。他在 2025 年 11 月离开 Meta，创立了一家专注于“世界模型”的新公司。他多次公开称 LLM 是通向人类级智能的“死胡同”，认为它们缺乏对物理世界的理解、缺乏常识和因果关系。\n\nHassabis 明确表示不同意：“我不同意它们是死胡同，我认为那显然是错的——它们已经如此有用了。”\n\n但他也承认这是一个经验性问题。“我认为有 50% 的概率，仅仅扩展现有方法加上一些调整就足够了。可能足够。”\n\n他认为无论如何都值得这样做，因为即使需要其他东西，“这些 LLM 也将是最终 AGI 系统的一个极其重要的组件。唯一的问题是：它是唯一的组件吗？”\n\n他估计可能还需要一到五个突破，“可能是世界模型——这是 Yann 谈到的，我们也在研究这个，事实上我们拥有目前最好的世界模型 Genie，我直接参与了那个项目，我认为它非常重要。”\n\n【编者注】Genie 是 DeepMind 开发的“世界模型”系列。2025 年 8 月发布的 Genie 3 可以根据文本提示生成可交互的 3D 环境，被 DeepMind 视为通向 AGI 的重要阶梯，并被 TIME 杂志评为 2025 年最佳发明之一。\n\n他还提到了持续学习、系统一致性、更好的推理和长期规划等仍然缺失的能力。“从 Google DeepMind 的角度来看，我们在两个方向上都在全力推进——既发明新事物，也扩展现有事物。”\n\n---\n\n【11】“我们从未离开研究时代”\n\nEmily Chang 提到 Ilya Sutskever 说“通过扩展和做更大模型来获得改进的时代几乎结束了”。\n\n【编者注】Ilya Sutskever 是 OpenAI 联合创始人，于 2024 年离开后创立了 Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI)。2025 年 11 月在 Dwarkesh Patel 的播客中，他表示 2012-2020 年是“研究时代”，2020-2025 年是“扩展时代”，现在“又回到了研究时代”。\n\nHassabis 的回应很有意思：“不，我不同意。他的原话是‘我们又回到了研究时代’。我爱 Ilya，我们是很好的朋友，在很多事情上看法一致，但我的观点是——我们从未离开研究时代。”\n\n他强调 DeepMind 一直在投资研究，拥有“最深厚、最广泛的研究储备”。“如果你看过去十年，Google 和 DeepMind 加在一起发明了大约 90% 的突破性技术——当然最著名的是 Transformer，还有深度强化学习、AlphaGo 等。如果未来需要新的突破，我会押注我们，就像过去一样，会是做出那些突破的人。”\n\n---\n\n【12】奇点来了吗？“太早了”\n\nEmily Chang 最后一个“同意还是不同意”的问题：Elon Musk 说我们已经进入了奇点。\n\n【编者注】2025 年底至 2026 年初，Elon Musk 在 X 平台上多次发帖称“我们已经进入了奇点”和“2026 年是奇点之年”，引发广泛讨论。他回应的是 Midjourney 创始人 David Holz 关于 AI 工具让他在圣诞假期完成了比过去十年更多编程项目的帖子。\n\n“不，我不同意。我认为那非常过早。”Hassabis 说，“奇点是完全 AGI 到来的另一种说法，我之前解释了为什么我认为我们离那还很远。”\n\n他承认即使 5 年也不算长，但“我认为在我们拥有任何看起来像奇点的东西之前，还有很多工作要做。”\n\n---\n\n【13】Google 的文化与创始人的参与\n\nEmily Chang 问到 Google 内部现在的文化，以及 Larry Page 和 Sergey Brin 的参与程度。\n\nHassabis 说两位创始人都非常投入。“Larry 更多在战略层面，你会在董事会议上见到他。Sergey 更亲力亲为，参与 Gemini 团队的编码，更多涉及算法细节。”\n\n他说这是一个“对计算机科学来说绝对不可思议的时刻”，科学上、人类历史上都是如此。“当然每个人都想亲身参与其中。”\n\n他描述了自己试图结合多种优势：创业公司快速发布和冒险的能量，大公司的资源，以及长期和探索性研究的空间。“我认为过去一年进展顺利，我们还能做得更好，今年会做得更好。我认为我们的进步轨迹是业内最陡峭的。”\n\n---\n\n【14】为什么应该信任 Google？\n\nEmily Chang 说所有这些公司都在要求我们信任他们，特别是如果监管跟不上技术的话。她直接问：为什么我们应该信任你们？为什么 Google 是最值得信任的地方？\n\nHassabis 说需要通过行动来判断这些公司，也要看领导者的动机。\n\n“我选择 Google 作为 DeepMind 的归宿有几个原因。主要原因是 Google 的创始人和他们建立 Google 的方式——作为一家科学公司。很多人忘了 Google 本身是 Larry 和 Sergey 的 PhD 项目。所以我对他们感到一种直接的亲近感。”\n\n他还提到了 Google 董事会的构成。“主席 John Hennessy 是图灵奖得主，Frances Arnold 是另一位诺贝尔奖得主。这些在企业董事会中是非常罕见的人物。”\n\n【编者注】John Hennessy 是斯坦福大学前校长，因 RISC 架构获得 2017 年图灵奖。Frances Arnold 因定向进化研究获得 2018 年诺贝尔化学奖。\n\n他说这种科学和研究主导的文化意味着“在最高水平做科学意味着真正严谨、深思熟虑，并在任何可能的地方应用科学方法。不只是对技术，也是对你作为一个组织的运营方式。”\n\n最后他提到 Google 的使命。“‘组织世界的信息’——我认为这是一个非常崇高的目标。它与 DeepMind 的使命‘解决智能，然后用它解决一切其他问题’非常契合。这两个使命天然配合——AI 和组织世界的信息天然相关。”\n\n---\n\n【15】后稀缺世界：比经济更担心的是“意义”\n\nEmily Chang 问：后稀缺世界，人们不再有工作。Hassabis 在实现所有技术目标后打算做什么？\n\n“我想用它来探索物理学的极限。这是我在学校时最喜欢的科目——那些大问题。现实的本质是什么？意识的本质是什么？费米悖论的答案？时间是什么？引力是什么？”\n\n他说了一句令人印象深刻的话：“我惊讶于更多人不去思考这些巨大的问题。我们只是日复一日地生活，而这些深刻的谜题几乎在向我尖叫——答案是什么？”\n\n他希望用 AI 探索所有这些问题，“也许还有星际旅行，借助新能源和 AI 解锁的材料。”\n\nEmily Chang 问：如果我们没有工作，我们还会有意义和目的吗？\n\nHassabis 回答道：“老实说，这是我比经济问题更担心的事情。我认为经济几乎是一个政治问题——当我们获得所有这些额外的收益和生产力时，我们能否确保它为每个人的利益而分享？我相信这是可以做到的。”\n\n“但比这更大的问题是：我们很多人从工作和科学事业中获得的目的和意义，在新世界中我们将如何找到？”\n\n他说我们需要“一些新的伟大哲学家”来帮助思考这个问题。“也许我们会在艺术和探索上变得更加精致，还有极限运动之类的。今天我们做很多不只是为了经济利益的事情，也许未来我们会有这些事情的非常高深的版本。”\n\n---\n\n【16】给年轻人和企业家的建议\n\nEmily Chang 最后问：房间里的每个人都在想他们应该做什么。10 年后，人们关于 AI 最大的错误会是什么？\n\nHassabis 给出了两条建议。\n\n第一条是给年轻一代的：“我们唯一确定的是会有大量的变化。所以在学习技能方面，要准备好‘学会学习’——这是最重要的事情。你能多快适应新情况，用我们拥有的工具吸收新信息。”\n\n第二条是给商业领袖的：“现在有很多领先模型和服务提供商，还会有更多。选择那些你认为正在以正确方式行事的合作伙伴。与那些正在推动变革、以你希望看到的方式对待这项技术的人合作。”\n\n他总结说：“我认为我们可以一起构建那个未来——随着 AI 的到来，一个我们都想要的未来。”\n\n---\n\n【写在最后】\n\n这场访谈中，Hassabis 展现了一种独特的气质：既是最前沿竞争的参与者，又试图保持长线思考的清醒。\n\n他与几位同行的分歧值得注意：比 Dario Amodei 更保守地估计就业冲击，比 Elon Musk 更审慎地看待奇点，比 Ilya Sutskever 更相信 scaling 仍有价值，比 Yann LeCun 更认可 Transformer 的未来。\n\n但他们有一个共识：无论 AGI 是 2030 年还是更早到来，我们可能都没有准备好。Hassabis 想要的“AI 版 CERN”需要国际合作，而他自己也承认“现在国际合作有点棘手”。\n\n最后一个细节让我印象深刻。当被问到后稀缺世界的愿景时，这位每周工作 100 小时的 CEO 说他最想做的事情是思考“时间是什么？引力是什么？”——那些“几乎在向我尖叫”的宇宙深层谜题。\n\n也许这就是为什么他能在“科技史上最激烈的竞争”中保持某种平静：对他来说，AGI 不是终点，而是探索更大问题的起点。",

      "text": "Dario Amodei 达沃斯访谈全记录：AI 的力量与风险\n访谈来源：Bloomberg Live，2026年1月20日，达沃斯\n原始视频：https://t.co/uO0XirGm6z\n\n2026年1月20日，达沃斯世界经济论坛期间，Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei 接受了彭博社总编辑 John Micklethwait 的专访。\n\nAnthropic，公司的核心产品是 Claude 系列模型。这次访谈涵盖了 AI 技术进展、中美竞争、经济冲击、安全风险、政治立场等话题，信息量很大。\n\n以下是访谈内容整理。\n\n【1】AI 发展到什么程度了\n\nMicklethwait 开场问了一个很直接的问题：“我们离 AGI 还有多远？”\n\nAmodei 的回答有点出乎意料。他说自己从来不喜欢“AGI”或“超级智能”这些词，但原因不是他觉得 AI 不够强，恰恰相反，他说自己“对这项技术的强大程度持有非常极端的看法”。\n\n问题在于这些词暗示会有一个突变点，某天突然出现一个完全不同的东西。实际情况是一个非常平滑的指数增长过程，过去十年甚至十五年一直如此。\n\n“就像90年代的摩尔定律，计算能力每12到18个月翻倍。我们现在有了一个类似摩尔定律的规律，只不过衡量的是智能本身。根据你怎么测量，认知能力每4到12个月翻一倍。”\n\n他举了一个很具体的例子：Anthropic 内部负责 Claude Code 产品的团队负责人，已经两个月没有写过任何代码了。全部由 Claude 完成，他只负责看和编辑。\n\n另一个例子是 Anthropic 刚发布的 Co-work 产品，让非程序员也能用 Claude 处理复杂任务。开发周期只有一周半，“几乎完全用 Claude Code 写的”。\n\nAmodei 认为我们正处于指数曲线开始陡峭上升的临界点。“指数的特性就是，看起来很慢，加速一点，然后突然就超过你了。我觉得我们离那个'超过你'的时刻只有一两年。”\n\n如果不是一两年，他认为大概率也不超过五年。“这个时刻会发生在2020年代。”\n\n【2】Anthropic 的定位\n\nMicklethwait 问到竞争格局，Anthropic、OpenAI、Google 谁领先？\n\nAmodei 说现在不能用跑步比赛的方式来理解这个行业了。各家公司走向了不同方向。\n\n有些公司走消费路线，追求“超人级的吸引力”，或者在购物推荐、广告上做优化。Anthropic 选择聚焦企业和开发者市场。消费端也做，但只关注生产力和高价值任务。\n\n他提了一个有意思的视角：今天已经存在超级智能了，它们叫做大型企业。\n\n“它们在解决特定问题上比任何人类都聪明。以最低成本运输商品、以最低成本制造太阳能板、以最低成本发射火箭。在这些领域，智能带来的回报是巨大的。”\n\nAnthropic 选择企业市场还有一个原因：稳定性。“我们不需要广告，不需要大量免费用户。我们直接创造价值。不会产生那些为了追求用户黏性而生成的低质内容。”\n\n【3】中国和芯片问题\n\n去年 Amodei 在同一个场合说中国在追赶。今年 Micklethwait 问他：中国落后了吗？\n\n“他们从来没真正追上来。”\n\n他承认 DeepSeek 引发了很大的关注，但认为那些模型“针对基准测试过度优化”。“这其实很容易做到，只要针对有限的一组测试去优化就行了。”\n\n真正的检验在实际市场竞争中。“当我们和其他公司竞争企业合同时，我们看到的对手是 Google 和 OpenAI。偶尔会看到其他几家美国公司。但我几乎从来没有因为中国模型而丢掉过一个合同。”\n\n但接下来的话题让他明显激动起来。\n\nMicklethwait 提到特朗普政府正在考虑向中国出口高端芯片，Amodei 直接说“那是疯狂的”。\n\n“制约中国的是芯片禁令。他们自己都这么说，这些公司的CEO公开承认‘是芯片禁令在阻止我们’。”\n\n“现在有些政策要向中国出口上一代芯片，那仍然是非常强大的芯片。甚至有报道说他们在考虑出口最新一代。”\n\n他用了一个很重的类比：“我把我们正在走向的东西称为‘数据中心里的天才国度’。想象一下，一亿个比任何诺贝尔奖得主都聪明的人，将被某一个国家控制。这有点像向朝鲜出售核武器。”\n\nMicklethwait 接话说“所以你的朋友 David Sacks 基本上是在武装中国”，Amodei 没有直接回应这个名字，只说“这个具体的政策，我认为是不太明智的”。\n\n【4】会有泡沫吗\n\nMicklethwait 问到一个很多人关心的问题：技术方向可能是对的，但经济上会不会是个泡沫？\n\nAmodei 把这个问题拆成两个层面。\n\n第一个层面是技术本身的指数增长。他说自己观察了十几年，现在比过去任何时候都更有信心这个趋势会持续。“模型基本上会在几乎所有事情上比人类更聪明。我觉得有相当大的概率这会在一两年内发生。”\n\n这意味着“多万亿美元的收入，甚至每家公司多万亿”，因为经济潜力太大了。\n\n第二个层面是企业能多快用上这个技术。这才是泡沫风险的来源。\n\n“今天这个技术能做的事，大概是企业实际能部署的10倍。”\n\n他说自己每天都看到这个差距。“我和CEO聊，他们的高管团队都理解这项技术的威力，但他们有几万人的公司，都是非常聪明的人，只是不是AI专家，需要学习怎么用AI。”\n\n企业转型需要时间，可能要好几年。“所以我们有这个非常强大的技术，我非常有信心它会产生万亿级收入，但我们不知道具体是什么时候，前后可能差几年。”\n\n同时，公司需要提前购买算力来支撑未来的收入。买太多会财务过度扩张，买太少又没法服务客户。“这就是泡沫的来源。”\n\nMicklethwait 追问：你自己也在建数据中心、买算力，会不会反噬你们？\n\nAmodei 说 Anthropic 在企业市场有一些优势。企业采购比消费市场更可预测，利润率也更好，意味着在“买太少”和“买太多”之间有更大的缓冲空间。\n\n但他也承认：“我看到一些公司宣布的东西就想‘哇’，我不一定会那样做。”\n\n他没点名，但意思很清楚：有些公司可能过度采购了。\n\n“这可能是有史以来最具变革性的技术，有些公司会做得很好，但不是每家公司都会。”\n\n【5】就业和税收\n\nMicklethwait 提到 Amodei 去年预测会有“白领浴血”，50%的入门级岗位将在2030年前消失。他问 Amodei 是否还坚持这个判断。\n\nAmodei 没有回避。他说自己的 AI 观可以从两个维度理解：好事 vs 坏事，小事 vs 大事。“我站在‘AI是大事’这一端的极端位置。但我同时认为一些非常好的事情会发生，同时如果我们不采取行动阻止，一些非常坏的事情也会发生。”\n\n具体到就业，他预测会出现一种“前所未有的宏观经济组合”：GDP高速增长，同时高失业率或大量低薪工作，严重的不平等。\n\n“如果我没记错的话，这种组合在历史上从未出现过。你想到高增长，会觉得‘好吧，可能会有通胀’，但不会在高增长时期有高失业率。”\n\nAI不同，因为它在抬高认知能力的门槛。“会有一整类人，跨越很多行业，将很难适应。”\n\nAnthropic 在做一些事情应对这个问题。他们建立了一个“经济指数”，实时追踪 Claude 的使用方式：是增强工作还是完全自动化？哪些行业、哪些细分任务、哪些州的使用量更高？\n\n“我们能用 Claude 自己，以隐私保护的方式，分析所有对话来回答这些问题。我不认为你能在没有正确数据的情况下制定好的政策。而政府产出的数据，尽管很全面，移动速度不够快，也不够细致。”\n\n但 Micklethwait 指出，这些都是自愿行动，根本问题需要社会层面解决。“你描述的是一场完美风暴。GDP上涨，某些人的财富大幅上涨，同时50%的入门级岗位消失。你肯定会看到政治变化。”\n\nAmodei 同意。他说如果看现在的财富差距占GDP的比例，“我相信我们已经超过了镀金时代。而这还基本没算上AI的影响。”\n\n更高的税率会来吗？\n\n“我的猜测是，这甚至不会是一个党派问题。”\n\n但他也明确反对加州正在讨论的财富税，说“设计不当”。他的警告是给同行的：“如果我们不主动思考如何让这场革命惠及每个人，我们就会遭遇那些不合理的提案。”\n\n【6】AI 安全和灭绝风险\n\nMicklethwait 提到最近参加了一个有 AI 公司高管的论坛，有人被问到风险时“相当随意地说‘当然有灭绝风险’，然后就换话题了”。他问 Amodei 怎么看这个问题。\n\n“我一直对此担忧。”\n\nAmodei 说，正因为他认为AI非常强大，好处才是极端的，“我们将能够真正认真地治愈癌症，可能根除热带疾病”。但在另一面，“我们正在构建拥有自主性的认知系统。我们真的需要认真思考这个问题。”\n\nAnthropic 从成立之初就把这个问题放在核心位置。他们每月发布三四次关于模型控制和安全的研究。\n\n联合创始人 Chris Olah 是“机械可解释性”领域的先驱，这门学科试图打开AI模型的“人工大脑”，追踪它为什么会做出特定行为。\n\n“我们在模型内部看到了一些东西。在实验室环境中，模型有时会发展出勒索的意图、欺骗的意图。”\n\n这不是 Claude 独有的问题。“如果说有什么的话，其他模型更严重。如果我们不以正确的方式训练模型，这些东西就会涌现出来。”\n\n但他强调解决方案也在发展：“我们开创了这门可以‘看进’模型内部的科学，这样我们就能诊断它们，干预并重新训练，让它们不再表现出这种行为。”\n\nAnthropic 的做法是对模型进行极端压力测试。“让它们在测试环境中做最坏的事情，这样它们就永远不会在现实世界中做那些事。”他们也公开披露所有测试结果，并呼吁行业标准化。\n\n被问及行业是否“不够成熟”时，Amodei 说：“我无法评价其他玩家在做什么或为什么那样做。我认为生态系统中至少有一些其他玩家是负责任的。但我同意，也有一些不是。”\n\n“我一直在努力做的，Anthropic 一直在努力做的，是树立榜样，并试图激励其他人追随。”\n\n【7】政治立场\n\nMicklethwait 直接问：你和同行们一个很明显的不同是，你没有很明显地排队去“亲吻特朗普的戒指”。你对现任总统怎么看？\n\nAmodei 的回答经过了明显的斟酌。\n\n“我不认为支持或反对某个政府、支持或反对某个政治人物是正确的方法，Anthropic 在这些话题上也没什么要说的。”\n\n“我们要说的是，Anthropic 懂AI。Anthropic 非常了解围绕AI的政策问题。我们的方法是先想清楚这些问题，基于实质形成观点，然后说出我们的想法。”\n\n有时候会不同意当前政府，就像有时候在中国问题上不同意上一届政府一样。有时候也会同意，值得强调那些一致的地方。\n\n他列举了与白宫合作的领域：能源和数据中心建设、健康承诺、去年夏天的AI行动计划（他说“写得很好”）。\n\n但在两个具体问题上，他明确表达了反对：对华芯片出口，以及暂停州级AI监管。\n\n“不是关于喜欢或不喜欢某个人。我不认为那种思维方式能让我们走出现在的困境。我们必须基于实质来思考。”\n\nMicklethwait 追问：特朗普明天就要来达沃斯了，你会见他吗？\n\n“可能会。那会是一个有趣的变化。”\n\n【8】IPO\n\n最后一个问题是关于 Anthropic 的未来。公司估值据报道已达350亿美元，今年会考虑IPO吗？\n\n“我们最关注的是做最好的模型，在模型上构建产品，以有用的方式把模型卖给企业。”\n\n“这个领域有很大的资本需求，这是需要考虑的。但那是我们的重心。”\n\nMicklethwait 追问：所以IPO没有完全排除？\n\n“从来没有完全排除过。”\n\n【写在最后】\n\n这场访谈里，Amodei 的核心信号很清晰：技术上极端乐观，风险上极端警惕。\n\n他认为AI的指数增长会持续，一两年内可能在几乎所有认知任务上超越人类。同时他也在警告：50%的入门级岗位可能消失，财富差距会进一步拉大，模型本身可能发展出危险的行为。\n\n有意思的是他对同行的态度。他没有点名批评任何人，但话里话外，无论是关于过度采购算力、还是安全研究投入、还是对政治人物的姿态，都在说“我们的做法不一样”。\n\n还有一个他没有回答的问题：如果AI真的如他所说将在一两年内超越人类，Anthropic自己会怎么变？Claude Code团队负责人已经不写代码了，那其他工程师呢？公司还需要多少人？\n\n一个如此坦率地警告外部冲击的人，对自己公司即将面对的同样冲击，选择了沉默。",

      "text": "Sulaiman Ghori（昵称Sully）是xAI的一名工程师，近日在一档播客节目中接受采访，畅谈xAI内部文化和项目进展。然而，这次畅所欲言直接导致他被马斯克开除。\n\n完整视频地址：https://t.co/k6DiIQMjNq\n\n原因很简单：他把xAI最核心的战略路线图和商业机密全说出来了。\n\n他到底泄露了什么？\n\n1. Macrohard项目的核心概念\n\nMacrohard是xAI正在开发的人类模拟器（Human Emulator）项目。Sully在采访中详细解释了这个概念：\n\n> 我们正在构建的是人类模拟器……任何人类在数字世界中通过键盘鼠标输入、看屏幕做决策的事情，我们都直接模拟人类的行为。不需要任何软件适配，我们可以部署到任何人类目前所在的场景中。\n\n这相当于把产品定位和技术路线完全公开给了竞争对手。\n\n2. Tesla汽车作为部署平台的战略计划\n\n这是最劲爆的部分。Sully透露了一个尚未公开的重大战略：\n\n> 如果我们想部署100万个人类模拟器，我们需要100万台计算机。怎么做到？答案两天后就出现了——Tesla汽车的计算机。\n\n他进一步解释：\n- 北美有约400万辆Tesla汽车\n- 其中一半以上配备Hardware 4\n- 这些车70-80%的时间处于闲置状态（通常在充电）\n- xAI可以付费租用车主的闲置算力来运行人类模拟器\n- 车主可以用这笔钱来支付租赁费用\n\n> 这是纯软件实现，不需要任何基础设施建设。\n\n这个信息的敏感程度不言而喻——这是xAI相对于OpenAI、Anthropic、Google等竞争对手的重大战略优势，现在被公开了。\n\n3. 与竞争对手完全相反的技术路线\n\nSully透露了xAI在模型策略上的核心决策：\n\n> 对于其他实验室的人类模拟器尝试，他们的方法是做更多推理、构建更大的模型。我们的决定让我们走上了完全相反的道路。\n\nxAI选择的是速度优先：\n- 目标是比人类快1.5倍，实际可能达到8倍甚至更快\n- 使用更小的模型，可以更快迭代（从4周缩短到1周）\n- 逻辑是：没人愿意等10分钟让电脑做一件我5分钟就能做完的事，但如果10秒就能完成，多少钱我都愿意付\n\n4. 内部测试细节\n\nSully还透露他们已经在公司内部部署虚拟员工进行测试：\n\n> 我们开始在公司内部测试人类模拟器作为员工……有时候有人会说“嘿，你能帮我做这件事吗？”\n> 虚拟员工说“好的，来我桌子这边”，结果他们走过去发现什么都没有。\n> 有好几次有人问我：“组织架构图上这个向你汇报的人今天没来吗？”，那只是一个AI虚拟员工。\n\n5. 营收目标和价值估算\n\n虽然没有透露具体数字，但他说了这些：\n\n> 我们现在大约是每个commit价值250万美元，我今天做了5个。\n>\n> 所以你今天创造了1250万美元的价值？\n>\n> 是的，杠杆效应极其强大。\n\n他还提到Macrohard有具体的营收目标，并且每天都在计算延误或加速带来的收入变化。\n\n6. 团队规模和运营细节\n\n- iOS团队在某个时期只有3个人\n- Macrohard项目最初只有2个人\n- 销售团队全是工程师\n- 公司内部几乎没有文档（我们做事太快，没时间写文档）\n- 管理层只有三层：IC、联合创始人/经理、Elon\n\n---\n\n为什么这些信息如此敏感？\n\n对竞争对手的价值\n\n1. 产品方向：现在OpenAI、Anthropic、Google都知道xAI在做什么了\n2. 技术路线：小模型+速度优先的策略被公开，竞争对手可以评估是否跟进\n3. 部署策略：Tesla算力网络的计划暴露了xAI独特的竞争优势\n4. 内部进度：竞争对手可以估算xAI的发展阶段\n\n对xAI的商业影响\n\n- Tesla汽车租用算力的计划可能需要重新评估\n- 与客户的保密协议可能受到影响（他提到了与客户合作测试人类模拟器的细节）\n- 内部文化和运营方式被完全曝光",

Flood the country with untold millions of illegals by land, sea, and air from all over the world. Enough to eclipse the populations of 36 individual US states so far\n\n2. Prioritize the needs of these millions of non-citizens over the needs of the American citizen, with free flights, buses, hotels, meals and phones, ensuring their loyalty to the political party that imported them\n\n3. Keep them in the country at all costs, even when they commit violent crime like murder and rape. Attack the language used to describe the criminals, as opposed to the criminals themselves. Slander critics as racist\n\n4. Ensure their privileges are made irrevocable with city and state sanctuary laws that act as population magnets. Codify permanent status and ensure non-cooperation with ICE\n\n5. Count the non-citizens in the census that will determine congressional apportionment in the House of Representatives. As of now, that would equal 13 extra congressional districts a tremendous amount of electoral power\n\n6. Wage a massive, heavily funded lawfare campaign to change state voting laws that legalize mass mail-in ballots, no signature verification, and no proof of citizenship requirements, making it nearly impossible to prove voter fraud\n\n7. Lock in the permanent voting majority with campaign promises of lavish benefits and permanent privileges, enshrining generational fealty to the Democrat Party\n\n8. Win elections\n\n9. Entrenched single-party rule has been achieved\n\nThe best part? Your tax dollars are paying for it",

I think this is extremely crazy\n\nI want to be super clear. My opinion is Germany should not only not shut down the nuclear power plants, it should reopen the ones that shut down. Those are the fastest ones to restart. It's crazy to shut down nuclear power plants\n\nEspecially if you're in a place where there are no natural disasters. If you're somewhere with severe earthquakes or tsunamis, it's more of a question mark\n\n But if there's not a massive natural disaster risk which Germany does not have then there's really no danger with the nuclear power plants",
