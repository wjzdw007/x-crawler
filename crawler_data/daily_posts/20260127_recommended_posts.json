          "text": "A few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.",

They didn’t just defend the shooting, they turned her killer into a hero and have mocked her death for five straight years. Their hypocrisy is so loud and rancid it makes their obnoxious red whistles seem quiet.\n\nThis isn’t “politics.” This is a communist insurgency, carried out by ppl who openly worship the ideology of Karl Marx and want to eliminate everyone to the right of him. They don’t care about life or “innocent victims.” They care about power, and they will justify any amount of bloodshed to get it.\n\nAccept where we are. It is not going to be pretty. Do not be manipulated by their narcissistic, emotional-blackmail warfare. The only way is through.",

What was done to her changed the course of her life. She lives with severe mental illness and addiction, which are recognised consequences of prolonged childhood sexual trauma. She has received no meaningful, consistent support since the offence occurred.\n\nBecause of that trauma, her children were removed from her care. I know this intimately, because I fostered two of them. They are my niece and nephews. Our family has lived with the impact of this crime for more than 27 years. \n\nThe man responsible was convicted of multiple offences involving underage girls. At the time of sentencing, in open court, he shouted that he would come back and sexually assault every woman and child in our family. That threat was made while judgment was being passed.\n\nHe was given a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nSince then, I have been repeatedly drawn back into the justice system through parole reviews. During the pandemic, Humberside Police’s serious crime unit contacted me to inform me he was again being considered for release.\n\nI provided a victim impact statement on my sister’s behalf, because she is not well enough to do so herself.\n\nWhat is less often understood is that the harm did not end with my sister.\n\nBecause of the threats made in court, and further conduct over time, I required legal protection. A non-molestation order and an exclusion zone were put in place to protect me, my children, and other women in our family.\n\nI am now also formally recognised as a victim of his actions.\n\nAfter serving over two decades in custody, he was released and then recalled to prison within months for breaching his licence conditions. He is currently back in custody. I am never told the full details. I am simply summoned again, year after year, to repeat the same process.\n\nThis is not a political position I have adopted.\nThis is not something I have joined late.\nThis is my family’s lived reality.\n\nThis is why I speak.\nThis is why I refuse silence.\nThis is why safeguarding and accountability matter to me.\n\nWhen I talk about child sexual exploitation, I am not speculating. I am describing a life my family has lived for more than two decades.\n\nMy position is clear.\n\nLife should mean life, I will continue to fight for life without parole for child rapists.",

What to know: the campaign is hosted by Chuffed and the first donation came from Jonny Soppotiuk, a Canada-based community organizer who is part of Chuffed leadership and specializes in fundraising. He is most likely a central figure in raising money. \n\nSo, yeah. Starting to look like foreigners are playing a key role in all of this. \n\nThat's not all. I've put together a spreadsheet of 4000+ donors and their possible identities. \n\n👇 Download in the next link below 👇",

It's a good question because it goes at a foundational level: what is my philosophy, and why does it lead to this conclusion?  \n\nSo the reason is that when I was a teenager, I had, like, an existential crisis to try to figure out what's the meaning of life. There doesn't seem to be any meaning. For me, at least the religious texts, and I read all of them that I could get my hands on, did not seem convincing. Then I started reading the philosophers.  \n\nBe careful of reading German philosophers as a teenager. It's definitely not going to help with your depression. So, reading Schopenhauer, Nietzsche as an adult, it's much more manageable. But as a kid, you're like, 'Whoa.'  \n\nSo then I was like, 'Man, I'm just struggling to find meaning in life here.' And then I read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And basically what Douglas Adams was saying is that we don't really know what the right questions are to ask. The question is not, 'What's the meaning of life?'  \n\nIn The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Earth, it turns out, is a big computer, and its goal is to answer the question, 'What's the meaning of life?' And Earth comes up with the answer '42'. This is where the 42 number comes from. And 420 is just ten times 42. In that book, which is really sort of a book about, it's an existential philosophy book disguised as humor. They come to the conclusion that the real problem is trying to formulate the question. And to really have the right question, you need a much bigger computer than Earth.  \n\nAnd so maybe one way, I think, of characterizing this would be to say, 'The universe is the answer. What is the question? Or what are the questions?'  \n\nThe more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, the better we can understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. The more we can expand consciousness, become a multi-planet species, ultimately a multistellar species… we have a chance of figuring out what the hell is going on. \n\nAnd so this is why I think we should have more humans and both biological and digital consciousness. And why we should become a multi-planet species and a multistellar species is so that we can understand the nature of the universe.  \n\nAnd then, in order for that to occur, then we have to make sure that things are good on Earth. We don't want Earth to disappear, so sustainable energy is important.”",

        "text": "As a former Special Forces Warrant Officer with multiple rotations running counterinsurgency ops—both hunting insurgents and trying to separate them from sympathetic populations—I’ve seen organized resistance up close. From Anbar to Helmand, the pattern is familiar: spotters, cutouts, dead drops (or modern equivalents), disciplined comms, role specialization, and a willingness to absorb casualties while bleeding the stronger force slowly.\n\nWhat’s unfolding in Minneapolis right now isn’t “protest.” It’s low-level insurgency infrastructure, built by people who’ve clearly studied the playbook.\n\nSignal groups at 1,000-member cap per zone. Dedicated roles: mobile chasers, plate checkers logging vehicle data into shared databases, 24/7 dispatch nodes vectoring assets, SALUTE-style reporting (Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time, Equipment) on suspected federal vehicles. Daily chat rotations and timed deletions to frustrate forensic recovery. Vetting processes for new joiners. Mutual aid from sympathetic locals (teachers providing cover, possible PD tip-offs on license plate lookups). Home-base coordination points. Rapid escalation from observation to physical obstruction—or worse.\n\nThis isn’t spontaneous outrage. This is C2 (command and control) with redundancy, OPSEC hygiene, and task organization that would make a SF team sergeant nod in recognition. Replace “ICE agents” with “occupying coalition forces” and the structure maps almost 1:1 to early-stage urban cells we hunted in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe most sobering part? It’s domestic. Funded, trained (somewhere), and directed by people who live in the same country they’re trying to paralyze law enforcement in. When your own citizens build and operate this level of parallel intelligence and rapid-response network against federal officers—complete with doxxing, vehicle pursuits, and harassment that’s already turned lethal—you’re no longer dealing with civil disobedience. You’re facing a distributed resistance that’s learned the lessons of successful insurgencies: stay below the kinetic threshold most of the time, force over-reaction when possible, maintain popular support through narrative, and never present a single center of gravity.\n\nI spent years training partner forces to dismantle exactly this kind of apparatus. Now pieces of it are standing up in American cities, enabled by elements of local government and civil society. That should keep every thinking American awake at night.\n\nNot because I want escalation. But because history shows these things don’t de-escalate on their own once the infrastructure exists and the cadre believe they’re winning the information war.\n\nWe either recognize what we’re actually looking at—or we pretend it’s still just “activism” until the structures harden and spread.\n\nYour call, America. But from where I sit, this isn’t January 2026 politics anymore.\nIt’s phase one of something we’ve spent decades trying to keep off our own soil.",

It’s about making sure the light of consciousness doesn’t go out if something catastrophic happens on Earth. Elon has consistently framed the Mars mission as the single most important step humanity can take to ensure long-term survival and expansion.\n\n“The key branching point for human destiny or destiny of consciousness as a whole is that Mars is self-sustaining, even if the resupply ships from Earth stop coming. You’re not multiplanetary until the planet can grow by itself. Because there’s always some risk of technology on Earth falling below a certain level or of a nuclear war or a meteor. You haven’t secured the future of civilization and consciousness until both planets can survive independently.”\n\nThis is why Mars matters:\n•  Backup for humanity — A second home protects against single-point failures (asteroids, supervolcanoes, pandemics, nuclear conflict, AI misalignment, etc.).\n•  Self-sustaining civilization — Once Mars can grow its own population and industry without constant Earth resupply, consciousness becomes multiplanetary and far more resilient.\n•  Inspiration & progress driver — The challenge forces breakthroughs in energy, life support, materials, AI, and closed-loop systems that benefit Earth too.\n•  Long-term species survival — Staying on one fragile planet forever is a gamble with extinction-level risks. Mars turns that into a hedge.\n\nEvery Starship launch, every refueling test, every iteration brings us closer to that branching point. It’s not luxury—it’s the ultimate act of responsibility toward future generations.",

Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined, including Falcon. \nNecessary, for a city on Mars.”\n\nThis massive scale unlocks:\n•  Hundreds of tons per flight to orbit (reusable 100–150+ tons, pushing higher in future versions) — critical for habitats, ISRU plants, power systems, and crew in fleet quantities.\n•  Orbital refueling efficiency — Huge propellant volume means fewer tanker launches to fill up for Mars transit.\n•  Rapid, high-cadence production — To deliver millions of tons over time, only a vehicle this big + fully reusable enables airline-like launch rates without bankrupting the effort.\n\nSmaller rockets? They’d need thousands of launches for what Starship fleets do in dozens—impractical for colonization timelines. Size = necessity for the tonnage bottleneck.\n\nEvery test flight refines this beast. The path to millions of tons on Mars starts with building big. Which upgrade—V4 thrust jumps, stretched tanks, or fleet-scale cadence—has you most pumped? Let’s accelerate to multiplanetary. 🚀🔴🌌",

You haven’t secured the future of civilization and consciousness until both planets can survive independently.“\n\nThis is the heartbeat of every Starship test: Flight after flight, iteration after iteration, we’re closing the gap from “possible” to “inevitable.” \n\nFrom orbital refueling demos to V4’s massive thrust upgrades (aiming for 10,000 tons total—3x Saturn V!), each milestone stacks the deck for that first uncrewed cargo run, then crewed landings, then city-building fleets.\n\nThe clock is ticking. Optimism + engineering = multiplanetary humanity. Which Starship milestone are you most hyped for in 2026? Let’s make the future arrive faster.",

Prompt 能解决的就交给 Prompt，Workflow 也未必非要 Skill 化或 Agent 化，复杂度一旦抬上去，后面只会越来越重。\n\n3. 为了 Skill 而 Skill，常见动机也就几种：学习、流量，还有某些理由。很不幸的是这一点和我之前那篇长文里的判断一致，我司内部已经能感受 Skill 批量生产的苗头。\n\n针对管理者，如果没想清楚 skill 到底能帮助你的团队解决什么问题，那就先想清楚。\n说一句不太好听的，如果一个公司或者一个团队去年造了一堆没用的 MCP，今年又开始打算铺开上 Skill，管理者要承担主要责任。这些时间和精力，本来完全可以用来推进更重要更有业务价值的事情。\n\n去年我一直逆着潮流遏制团队制造毫无价值的 mcp 垃圾，今年也会继续遏制无意义的 skill。\n\n做正确的事这个初衷不会变，哪怕看起来不那么“政治正确”，但能把时间留给真正重要的事情。\n\n宝玉这条，如果能读懂就应该给 Skills 降温，如果能引起反思我觉得是好事。\n因需而建比一股脑全上要重要得多。",

No one in history has ever built a fully reusable rocket, and that’s why access to space is still insanely expensive — We’ve already landed Falcon 9 boosters over 500 times, but we still throw away the upper stage — and that alone costs as much as a small jet. Starship changes everything. When every part of a rocket comes back, space stops being exclusive and starts becoming scalable.\n\nStarship is the largest flying machine ever made — built for Mars, the Moon, and massive satellite deployment. But the real revolution isn’t where it goes… it’s that it comes back. Full reusability is the single biggest lever for lowering the cost of space in human history.\n\nAutomation and AI matter — but without full reusability, space will always be expensive. Starship is designed to change the economics entirely. Prove full reusability, and the cost of reaching orbit drops by a factor of 100. That’s how Mars stops being a dream and starts being a plan.",

One was when FSD was cautious around pedestrians on Berkeley's campus. I recall a student who wasn't using the crosswalk but was close to it, walking across the road. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation.\n\nThe system also managed to navigate the university's roads and perform a three-point turn when I stopped the car and added a new destination.\"",

Preliminary Relief Focus\n\n∙In 18 of 21 active cases, plaintiffs sought preliminary injunction/TRO\n\n∙Strategy: Block implementation immediately, worry about final merits later\n\n∙Creates “status quo” bias against Trump policies even if ultimately upheld\n\n3. Coalition Plaintiffs\n\n∙No case has single plaintiff; average is 4.3 organizational plaintiffs\n\n∙Builds appearance of broad opposition\n\n∙Provides backup standing arguments if one plaintiff fails\n\n4. Coordination Across \nOrganizations\n\n∙SUDC focuses state-level election cases\n\n∙CREW handles federal ethics/emoluments\n\n∙Protect Democracy takes constitutional structure\n\n∙Minimizes appearance of single entity driving all litigation\n5. Media Synchronization\n\n∙Court filings coordinated with CNN appearances, op-eds, Congressional testimony\n\n∙Litigation as public narrative tool, not just legal remedy\n\n6. Scholarly Credibility\n\n∙Eisen’s Brookings affiliation provides academic veneer\n\n∙Papers cited by plaintiffs give appearance of neutral scholarly consensus\n\n∙Contrast with Elias, who’s openly partisan operative\n\nThe Funding Question\n\nTotal spending by Eisen-affiliated organizations (2025 fiscal year):\n\n∙States United Democracy Center: $32.4M\n∙CREW: $28.7M\n∙Protect Democracy: $24.1M\n∙Democracy Forward: $15.8M\n∙Combined: $101 million\n\nThis doesn’t include:\n∙Outside law firms working pro bono or reduced rates\n∙Individual donor funding of specific cases\n∙Dark money pass-throughs (Sixteen Thirty Fund, others)\nWhere money comes from (aggregated from tax filings):\n\nMajor Foundation Support:\n∙Open Society Foundations (Soros): ~$12M across orgs\n∙Wyss Foundation: ~$8M\n∙Democracy Fund: ~$6M\n∙Sixteen Thirty Fund: ~$15M (itself funded by undisclosed donors)\n\nIndividual Mega-Donors (disclosed contributions >$100k):\n∙Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn founder): ~$4M\n∙Laurene Powell Jobs (Steve Jobs widow): ~$3M\n∙Pierre Omidyar (eBay founder): ~$2M\n∙Dustin Moskovitz (Facebook co-founder): ~$2M\n\nA bunch of billionaires control everything that’s going on because they file a lawsuit every single time Trump does something.
