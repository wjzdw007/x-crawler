        "text": "I wanted to say a few words about @Tesla and @elonmusk regarding their decision, announced during yesterday's earnings call, to end the production of the Model S and X in Q2 this year.  \n\nFrom the start, I have been a giant fan, investor and supporter of Tesla.  I was the happy purchaser of the 2008 Roadster and 2012 Model S, both VIN #003.  I continue to hold them in pristine condition until one day they go into either the (hopeful!) Tesla Museum or another tech or automotive museum.  I still drive my 2010 Roadster and I have owned a number of Model S's and Model X's over the years.  \n\nAs I once told Elon, the Model S (Motortrend's Car of the Year for 2012) goes alongside the PC, Mac, iPad and iPhone as the greatest consumer tech products ever created, in my opinion.  \n\nI recently upgraded my personal, older Tesla's with 2026 Model S's (Plaid and Long Range) and a 2026 Model X Plaid.  They are all the best cars I have ever owned.  I did this even knowing that the writing was on the wall that they would be discontinued as the sales numbers were a rounding error compared to the Model 3 and Y.  I did buy a 2026 Model Y as well when it came out...it is an excellent car and at the price, a very good value. \n\nOver the years, I also subsidized employees across my various organizations with a $7500 credit towards the purchase of a Tesla...and that was on top of the Federal EV credits when they existed.  I am proud to have introduced 100s of people to owning Tesla vehicles, especially in the early days when the sales mattered.  \n\nWhile I will miss future versions of the S and X, I have no doubt that Tesla will continue to make great cars and the FSD is now amazing, so I have little doubt that whatever package the FSD is wrapped inside, it will be a great experience.  \n\nElon always said that Tesla was intended to be more than a car company and today it is already a major player in renewable energy, manufacturing, software and well on its way to being a winner in robotics and whatever future areas of tech hold the most promise.   \n\nSo farewell to the Model S and X, with gratitude for the many years of enjoyment and hello to the future!",

      "text": "微博刚发布的《2025 热点趋势报告》 ，有些有意思的点。\n\n以后内容会有两套评价体系：人类流量 vs AI 权重。\n\n一、AI 从“科幻感”变成了“生活感”\n\n报告用了一个很精准的描述：2025 年，AI 真正卸下未来世界的光环，迈向深入社会肌理的实干元年。\n\n看看 2023-2025 三年 AI 热搜的变化：\n\n1) 2023 年——尝鲜试探期\n\n“AI 写高考作文”“高考前被 AI 的回答鼓励到了”“用 AI 的方式打开诗词里的中秋”“ChatGPT 解读董宇辉回应长文”……\n\n那时候大家主要是尝鲜，像拿到新玩具一样试探 AI 的边界。能写诗？能写作文？能解读长文？哇，好厉害。但也仅此而已，AI 还带着浓浓的科幻滤镜。\n\n2) 2024 年——伦理焦虑期\n\n“AI 换脸 7000 张裸照”“泰勒斯威夫特 AI 不雅照疯传”“乔任梁父亲喊话撕下 AI 复活明星伪善面具”“查重率没超 3% 却被检测出 AI 代写”“雷军澄清近期雷军 AI 配音”……\n\n24 年最流行的词之一是 FOMO（错失恐惧症），但 AI 热搜里弥漫的更多是焦虑：换脸诈骗、隐私侵犯、学术造假、AI 复活争议……大家开始意识到这技术可能被滥用，社会还没准备好。\n\n3) 2025 年——落地深耕期\n\n“DeepSeek 一两分钟干了我一两天的活”“00 后用 DeepSeek 一天卖出 3.3 亿”“用 DeepSeek 买彩票真中奖了”“DeepSeek 评以为很卫生实际巨脏的行为”“DeepSeek 评中国最宜居城市”……\n\n注意这些热搜的共同点：全是实用场景。赚钱、工作、生活决策。用户不再问“AI 能干嘛”，而是问“AI 能帮我干什么”。\n\n报告说得好：用户已经不满足用 AI 写一首蹩脚的诗，而是实现了从玩具到“刚需工具”的使用跨越。\n\n两年时间，用户心态完成质变。而 DeepSeek 的出现，某种程度上加速了这个进程，它让更多普通人第一次真正“用上”了 AI，而不只是“玩过”AI。\n\n二、用户看新闻追热点的方式变了\n\n微博作为互联网热点的发源地，2025 年自己也经历了一场 AI 驱动的进化：微博智搜。\n\n以前查热点的体验：\n搜关键词，出来一堆碎片。博主 A 爆料一句，媒体 B 报道一段，官方 C 发个通报，评论区还有 D、E、F 各种补充和反转。你得自己当侦探，把这些碎片拼装成完整事实。或者等某个大神出来帮你“总结吃瓜”。\n\n现在用智搜的体验：\n问一句话，拿到的是 AI 整理好的“事实/观点包”。它自动把博主发帖、媒体报道、官方通报串联起来，给你一个全景式的热点视图。\n\n报告里的数据：\n- 52% 的智搜使用场景是“热点解读”，用户要深度分析、要背景信息\n- 48% 是“实时解答”，用户要即时查询、要快速确认\n\n核心诉求只有一个：用户要的不再是线索，而是答案。\n\n再看内容消费的领域分布：\n\n- 文娱领域 52%（明星动态、娱乐事件）\n- 垂直领域 28%（专业知识、兴趣爱好）\n- 社会领域 20%（社会新闻、公共事件）\n\n文娱主导、热点驱动、实时追踪，这就是 AI 时代用户消费信息的核心特征。\n\n这不只是效率提升，是信息获取方式的根本改变。当用户习惯了“被喂答案”，对整个信息生态意味着什么？这个问题值得所有内容创作者思考。\n\n三、内容的价值标准变了\n\n报告里有句话让我印象很深：\n\n> “内容的生命力不再仅仅取决于点赞数，更取决于它在 AI 知识图谱中的权重。”\n\n这句话的含义是：以后写东西，不只要想“读者爱不爱看”，还要想“AI 会不会引用”。\n\n为什么？因为当越来越多用户通过 AI 智搜获取信息时，你的内容能不能被 AI 纳入那个“事实/观点包”，直接决定了它的传播半径。\n\n标题党、情绪化内容可能依然能收割流量，但不一定被 AI 采纳进答案。AI 整合信息时，更倾向选择原创的、结构清晰的、有实质内容的素材。\n\n报告的行业建议也印证了这点：原创的、具有独特视角的深度内容，在 AI 时代反而更具溢价能力。\n\n举个亲身例子。昨天有位网友跟我说：\n\n> 说到 skill 还得是宝玉老师，对 skill 的推动普及功不可没，列两个日常的感知：当我用 AI 做关于 skill 的 deep research，AI 引用了宝玉老师的观点；在内网看相关技术博客，文章最后也是引用了宝玉老师的观点。\n\n像我这样的“干货”博主，在流量时代不一定吃香，毕竟干货阅读门槛高，没有情绪价值，不容易爆。但在 AI 时代可能会不一样：当 AI 需要整合某个领域的权威观点时，那些长期输出专业内容、建立起知识权重的创作者，反而会被更多地引用和传播。\n\n以后内容会有两套评价体系：人类流量 vs AI 权重。\n\n两者不一定冲突，但也不完全重合。一篇 10w+ 的情绪爆文，可能在 AI 知识图谱里权重为零；一篇阅读量平平的专业分析，可能被 AI 反复引用、触达百万用户。\n\n这是挑战，也是机会。如果你本来就擅长深度内容，AI 时代终于有了新的分发渠道，不用再单纯拼情绪和标题。",

The day after the crash, ICE placed a detainer on the illegal alien — but he was released because the \"sanctuary city\" of Minneapolis refused to honor it.\n\nMonths later, when he was finally charged, he was (predictably) nowhere to be found. When he was finally arrested on the outstanding warrant, officials released him AGAIN despite ICE placing another detainer on him that very same day.\n\nFortunately, ICE tracked this criminal illegal alien down and deported him back to his home country where he belongs.\n\nAll ICE was asking was that officials notify them when he was released so they could arrest him in the safety of the jail rather than expend significant resources to locate and arrest him in public — something that jeopardizes both the officers' safety and the safety of the public.\n\nInstead, Minneapolis officials did everything in their power to keep the criminal illegal alien roaming the streets of their city.\n\nThis is the dangerous policy that @GovTimWalz, @MayorFrey, @AGEllison, and other Democrats support.",

For coding, I prefer Codex because it can navigate large codebases. You can prompt and have 95% certainty that it actually works. With Claude Code you need more tricks to get the same.\"\n\n\"But character wise, [Opus] behaves so good in a Discord it kind of feels like a human. I've only really experienced that with Opus.\"",

Where were rapists in Sweden born?\n\nThe largest group was born outside of Sweden, followed by those born inside Sweden with both parents born in Sweden. \n\nThe former finding doesn't make much sense, since they're such a small part of the population, but the latter does, since they're the overwhelming majority of the population.\n\nSo let's look into these slices. \n\nFirst up: the 5.7% of rapists born in Sweden with one parent from Sweden. We're going to look at where their parent born outside Sweden was from.\n\nTheir dominant source? Other Western Countries.\n\nNow what about the 5.8% of the rapists born in Sweden who had two parents born outside of Sweden?\n\nThey were considerably less Western than those with one Swedish-born parent. \n\nOnto the final and most numerous group: rapists born outside Sweden.\n\nNow that we know their demographics, let's check some other details. Per the paper, we know that \n\n- 32.5% received social welfare\n- 37.3% had low education\n- They scored 0.5 d below the mean for resilience\n- They scored 0.6 d below the mean for IQ\n- They scored 0.95 d below the mean for school achievement\n \nIn terms of prior convictions, 46.1% had committed a violent crime and 36.8% had committed a property crime. 15.9% had a psychiatric disorder and 19.3% had an alcohol use disorder, while 21% had a drug use disorder.\n\nTheir parents were little better: 0.5% of the sample had at least one rapist parent, 16.2% had a white collar criminal parent, 26.4% had a property criminal parent, and 18.6% had a violent criminal as a parent. 24.5% had parents with psychiatric disorders, and 9.4% had parents with histories of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nWith all of that said, the majority of the rapists were still classified as a priori low-risk.\n\n You can check out the study this data is from here: https://t.co/sPeaBOjtEl",

People who point out that the emperor has no clothes will be crushed. Katherine Maher of Wikimedia said it best herself. “Our reverence for the truth is a hindrance to getting things done.” (Paraphrasing)\n\nWe’re living in a world where lies don’t matter anymore.

          "text": "A few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.",

How they celebrated. How they justified it. How hundreds of thousands of people liked a post where Amanda Seyfried said he deserved it.\n\nThen remember how enraged they were when President Trump moved his head and survived an assassination attempt on live television… something that would have thrown this country into chaos, if not outright civil war.\n\nRemember how they built shrines and merch for Luigi Magionie after he murdered an innocent man in cold blood.\n\nAnd Ashli Babbitt? They didn’t just defend the shooting, they turned her killer into a hero and have mocked her death for five straight years. Their hypocrisy is so loud and rancid it makes their obnoxious red whistles seem quiet.\n\nThis isn’t “politics.” This is a communist insurgency, carried out by ppl who openly worship the ideology of Karl Marx and want to eliminate everyone to the right of him. They don’t care about life or “innocent victims.” They care about power, and they will justify any amount of bloodshed to get it.\n\nAccept where we are. It is not going to be pretty. Do not be manipulated by their narcissistic, emotional-blackmail warfare. The only way is through.",

        "text": "People often ask me why I speak publicly about grooming gangs and child sexual exploitation, and why I hold MPs to account regardless of party.\n\nThis is why.\n\nIn 1998, my teenage sister was abducted and subjected to hours of rapes and sodomy, he left her for dead. What was done to her changed the course of her life. She lives with severe mental illness and addiction, which are recognised consequences of prolonged childhood sexual trauma. She has received no meaningful, consistent support since the offence occurred.\n\nBecause of that trauma, her children were removed from her care. I know this intimately, because I fostered two of them. They are my niece and nephews. Our family has lived with the impact of this crime for more than 27 years. \n\nThe man responsible was convicted of multiple offences involving underage girls. At the time of sentencing, in open court, he shouted that he would come back and sexually assault every woman and child in our family. That threat was made while judgment was being passed.\n\nHe was given a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nSince then, I have been repeatedly drawn back into the justice system through parole reviews. During the pandemic, Humberside Police’s serious crime unit contacted me to inform me he was again being considered for release.\n\nI provided a victim impact statement on my sister’s behalf, because she is not well enough to do so herself.\n\nWhat is less often understood is that the harm did not end with my sister.\n\nBecause of the threats made in court, and further conduct over time, I required legal protection. A non-molestation order and an exclusion zone were put in place to protect me, my children, and other women in our family.\n\nI am now also formally recognised as a victim of his actions.\n\nAfter serving over two decades in custody, he was released and then recalled to prison within months for breaching his licence conditions. He is currently back in custody. I am never told the full details. I am simply summoned again, year after year, to repeat the same process.\n\nThis is not a political position I have adopted.\nThis is not something I have joined late.\nThis is my family’s lived reality.\n\nThis is why I speak.\nThis is why I refuse silence.\nThis is why safeguarding and accountability matter to me.\n\nWhen I talk about child sexual exploitation, I am not speculating. I am describing a life my family has lived for more than two decades.\n\nMy position is clear.\n\nLife should mean life, I will continue to fight for life without parole for child rapists.",

It's a good question because it goes at a foundational level: what is my philosophy, and why does it lead to this conclusion?  \n\nSo the reason is that when I was a teenager, I had, like, an existential crisis to try to figure out what's the meaning of life. There doesn't seem to be any meaning. For me, at least the religious texts, and I read all of them that I could get my hands on, did not seem convincing. Then I started reading the philosophers.  \n\nBe careful of reading German philosophers as a teenager. It's definitely not going to help with your depression. So, reading Schopenhauer, Nietzsche as an adult, it's much more manageable. But as a kid, you're like, 'Whoa.'  \n\nSo then I was like, 'Man, I'm just struggling to find meaning in life here.' And then I read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And basically what Douglas Adams was saying is that we don't really know what the right questions are to ask. The question is not, 'What's the meaning of life?'  \n\nIn The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Earth, it turns out, is a big computer, and its goal is to answer the question, 'What's the meaning of life?' And Earth comes up with the answer '42'. This is where the 42 number comes from. And 420 is just ten times 42. In that book, which is really sort of a book about, it's an existential philosophy book disguised as humor. They come to the conclusion that the real problem is trying to formulate the question. And to really have the right question, you need a much bigger computer than Earth.  \n\nAnd so maybe one way, I think, of characterizing this would be to say, 'The universe is the answer. What is the question? Or what are the questions?'  \n\nThe more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, the better we can understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. The more we can expand consciousness, become a multi-planet species, ultimately a multistellar species… we have a chance of figuring out what the hell is going on. \n\nAnd so this is why I think we should have more humans and both biological and digital consciousness. And why we should become a multi-planet species and a multistellar species is so that we can understand the nature of the universe.  \n\nAnd then, in order for that to occur, then we have to make sure that things are good on Earth.

        "text": "As a former Special Forces Warrant Officer with multiple rotations running counterinsurgency ops—both hunting insurgents and trying to separate them from sympathetic populations—I’ve seen organized resistance up close. From Anbar to Helmand, the pattern is familiar: spotters, cutouts, dead drops (or modern equivalents), disciplined comms, role specialization, and a willingness to absorb casualties while bleeding the stronger force slowly.\n\nWhat’s unfolding in Minneapolis right now isn’t “protest.” It’s low-level insurgency infrastructure, built by people who’ve clearly studied the playbook.\n\nSignal groups at 1,000-member cap per zone. Dedicated roles: mobile chasers, plate checkers logging vehicle data into shared databases, 24/7 dispatch nodes vectoring assets, SALUTE-style reporting (Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time, Equipment) on suspected federal vehicles. Daily chat rotations and timed deletions to frustrate forensic recovery. Vetting processes for new joiners. Mutual aid from sympathetic locals (teachers providing cover, possible PD tip-offs on license plate lookups). Home-base coordination points. Rapid escalation from observation to physical obstruction—or worse.\n\nThis isn’t spontaneous outrage. This is C2 (command and control) with redundancy, OPSEC hygiene, and task organization that would make a SF team sergeant nod in recognition. Replace “ICE agents” with “occupying coalition forces” and the structure maps almost 1:1 to early-stage urban cells we hunted in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe most sobering part? It’s domestic. Funded, trained (somewhere), and directed by people who live in the same country they’re trying to paralyze law enforcement in. When your own citizens build and operate this level of parallel intelligence and rapid-response network against federal officers—complete with doxxing, vehicle pursuits, and harassment that’s already turned lethal—you’re no longer dealing with civil disobedience. You’re facing a distributed resistance that’s learned the lessons of successful insurgencies: stay below the kinetic threshold most of the time, force over-reaction when possible, maintain popular support through narrative, and never present a single center of gravity.\n\nI spent years training partner forces to dismantle exactly this kind of apparatus. Now pieces of it are standing up in American cities, enabled by elements of local government and civil society. That should keep every thinking American awake at night.\n\nNot because I want escalation. But because history shows these things don’t de-escalate on their own once the infrastructure exists and the cadre believe they’re winning the information war.\n\nWe either recognize what we’re actually looking at—or we pretend it’s still just “activism” until the structures harden and spread.\n\nYour call, America. But from where I sit, this isn’t January 2026 politics anymore.\nIt’s phase one of something we’ve spent decades trying to keep off our own soil.",

It’s about making sure the light of consciousness doesn’t go out if something catastrophic happens on Earth. Elon has consistently framed the Mars mission as the single most important step humanity can take to ensure long-term survival and expansion.\n\n“The key branching point for human destiny or destiny of consciousness as a whole is that Mars is self-sustaining, even if the resupply ships from Earth stop coming. You’re not multiplanetary until the planet can grow by itself. Because there’s always some risk of technology on Earth falling below a certain level or of a nuclear war or a meteor. You haven’t secured the future of civilization and consciousness until both planets can survive independently.”\n\nThis is why Mars matters:\n•  Backup for humanity — A second home protects against single-point failures (asteroids, supervolcanoes, pandemics, nuclear conflict, AI misalignment, etc.).\n•  Self-sustaining civilization — Once Mars can grow its own population and industry without constant Earth resupply, consciousness becomes multiplanetary and far more resilient.\n•  Inspiration & progress driver — The challenge forces breakthroughs in energy, life support, materials, AI, and closed-loop systems that benefit Earth too.\n•  Long-term species survival — Staying on one fragile planet forever is a gamble with extinction-level risks. Mars turns that into a hedge.\n\nEvery Starship launch, every refueling test, every iteration brings us closer to that branching point. It’s not luxury—it’s the ultimate act of responsibility toward future generations.",

The key threshold for that is if the supply ships from Earth stop coming for any reason, Mars does not die out\n\nThat is the critical \"Great Filter,\" if you talk about things in terms of the Fermi Paradox\n\n\"The Great Filter is Mars being self-sustaining without any supply ships from Earth\"\n\nUntil we reach that point, we are really just a one-planet civilization with an extension. If Mars becomes self-sustaining, then even in a worst-case scenario of Earth’s civilization either dying with a bang or a whimper Mars would have a much better chance of surviving\n\nSo, the intent here overall is to ensure that the light of consciousness, which appears to be just a tiny candle in a vast darkness\"",
