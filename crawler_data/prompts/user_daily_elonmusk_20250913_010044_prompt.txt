        "text": "NOW: Journalist Michael Shellenberger just dropped the hammer...and said what the media will NEVER admit about Charlie Kirk’s assassination.\n\nThis isn’t about one deranged shooter. \n\nThis is about an ENTIRE malignant culture that made political violence inevitable.  \n\nNow @shellenberger says it’s time for those responsible to be held accountable. \n\n“Look, I think it’s not likely to happen but the people that did this dehumanization need to take responsibility for it.”\n\n“I don’t think that it’s good enough not to just express lament about the assassination of Charlie Kirk.”\n\n“I think the media, the left, the universities in particular, need to own up to the fact that they participated in the very dehumanization that they for decades had been criticizing when done by people on the right.”\n\n“I don’t think that healing is going to be possible until some acknowledgement of really a decade-long dehumanization of roughly half of the country.”",
