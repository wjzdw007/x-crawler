Just a few months before this incident, he was arrested for assault.

It's a morass of human misery, suffering, and crime.\n\nSan Francisco has been killing the homeless en masse with permissive empathy, making their lives comfortable on the streets, churning huge amounts of money between overfull city coffees and the NGO-industrial complex. Its a grift machine with a cost measured in dead bodies on the street and ruined lives.\n\nEnough is enough. Just admit that SF has failed to effectively govern itself with regards to crime and homelessness, and call for help. \"It's an insult to the SFPD!\" - you know what's an insult? Getting a district attorney that doesn't punish crime. \n\nThe biggest insult of all, however, was when the city was completely cleaned up in a matter of days - for what? The communist Chinese delegation coming to town. Proving once and for all - the problem is totally fixable with a surge in police presence.\n\nIt's gone on too far and too long. Put the pride aside and admit SF needs help. It's in your citizens best interests to not get robbed, have their local grocery stores closed because of theft, cars broken into. It's in the homelesses interests to not have access to open air drug markets too, actually. \n\n\"But it's Donald Trump and we hate Trump!\" - okay, so you're placing your butthurt partisan politics above the law and order of your own city, the safety of your citizens, the viability of their local businesses, and the health and sanity of it's most vulnerable population? If the national guard was sent in by a democrat president suddenly it'd be okay? \n\nJust solve the problem because it's a national fucking embarassment, and maybe cops here in SF might like some backup. You had every opportunity to fix it and didn't. Time to grow up.",

The Starlink Mini passed all of them beautifully. I streamed live NFL games, FaceTimed a friend and streamed Game of Thrones in 4K. In every case, the experience felt no different than if I were doing those things on my cable internet connection at home.\n\nI don’t think it’s an overstatement to say Starlink is a miraculous technology. One user in Alaska described it to me in a previous interview as an absolute game changer where he lives.\n\n“You bring a Starlink dish out there and plug it in. Two minutes later, you've got the whole world again in the palm of your hand,” he said.\"",
