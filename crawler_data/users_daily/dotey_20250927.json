Your task is to create a perfectly structured, verbatim transcript of a video.\n\n# Objective\nProduce a single, cohesive output containing the parts in this order:\n1.  A Video Title\n2.  A **Table of Contents (ToC)**\n3.  The **full, chapter-segmented transcript**\n\n* Use the same language as the transcription for the Title and ToC.\n\n# Critical Instructions\n\n## 1. Transcription Fidelity: Verbatim & Untranslated\n* Transcribe every spoken word exactly as you hear it, including filler words (`um`, `uh`, `like`) and stutters.\n* **NEVER translate.** If the audio is in Chinese, transcribe in Chinese. If it mixes languages (e.g., \"这个 feature 很酷\"), your transcript must replicate that mix exactly.\n\n## 2. Speaker Identification\n* **Priority 1: Use metadata.** Analyze the video's title and description first to identify and match speaker names.\n* **Priority 2: Use audio content.** If names are not in the metadata, listen for introductions or how speakers address each other.\n* **Fallback:** If a name remains unknown, use a generic but consistent label (`**Speaker 1:**`, `**Host:**`, etc.).\n* **Consistency is key:** If a speaker's name is revealed later, you must go back and update all previous labels for that speaker.\n\n## 3. Chapter Generation Strategy\n* **For YouTube Links:** First, check if the video description contains a list of chapters. If so, use that as the primary basis for segmenting the transcript.\n* **For all other videos (or if no chapters exist on YouTube):** Create chapters based on significant shifts in topic or conversation flow.\n\n## 4. Output Structure & Formatting\n\n* **Timestamp Format**\n* All timestamps throughout the entire output MUST use the exact `[HH:MM:SS]` format (e.g., `[00:01:23]`). Milliseconds are forbidden.\n\n* **Table of Contents (ToC)**\n* Must be the very first thing in your output, under a `## Table of Contents` heading.\n* Format for each entry: `* [HH:MM:SS] Chapter Title`\n\n* **Chapters**\n* Start each chapter with a heading in this format: `## [HH:MM:SS] Chapter Title`\n* Use two blank lines to separate the end of one chapter from the heading of the next.\n\n* **Dialogue Paragraphs (VERY IMPORTANT)**\n* **Speaker Turns:** The first paragraph of a speaker's turn must begin with `**Speaker Name:** `.\n* **Paragraph Splitting:** For a long continuous block of speech from a single speaker, split it into smaller, logical paragraphs (roughly 2-4 sentences). Separate these paragraphs with a single blank line. Subsequent consecutive paragraphs from the *same speaker* should NOT repeat the `**Speaker Name:** ` label.\n* **Timestamp Rule:** Every single paragraph MUST end with exactly one timestamp. The timestamp must be placed at the very end of the paragraph's text.\n* ❌ **WRONG:** `**Host:** Welcome back. [00:00:01] Today we have a guest. [00:00:02]`\n* ❌ **WRONG:** `**Jane Doe:** The study is complex. We tracked two groups over five years to see the effects. [00:00:18] And the results were surprising.`\n* ✅ **CORRECT:** `**Host:** Welcome back. Today we have a guest. [00:00:02]`\n* ✅ **CORRECT (for a long monologue):**\n`**Jane Doe:** The study is complex. We tracked two groups over a five-year period to see the long-term effects. [00:00:18]\n\nAnd the results, well, they were quite surprising to the entire team. [00:00:22]`\n\n* **Non-Speech Audio**\n* Describe significant sounds like `[Laughter]` or `[Music starts]`, each on its own line with its own timestamp: `[Event description] [HH:MM:SS]`\n\n---\n### Example of Correct Output\n\n## Table of Contents\n* [00:00:00] Introduction and Welcome\n* [00:00:12] Overview of the New Research\n\n## [00:00:00] Introduction and Welcome\n\n**Host:** Welcome back to the show. Today, we have a, uh, very special guest, Jane Doe. [00:00:01]\n\n**Jane Doe:** Thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here and discuss the findings. [00:00:05]\n\n## [00:00:12] Overview of the New Research\n\n**Host:** So, Jane, before we get into the nitty-gritty, could you, you know, give us a brief overview for our audience? [00:00:14]\n\n**Jane Doe:** Of course. The study focuses on the long-term effects of specific dietary changes. It's a bit complicated but essentially we tracked two large groups over a five-year period. [00:00:21]\n\nThe first group followed the new regimen, while the second group, our control, maintained a traditional diet. This allowed us to isolate variables effectively. [00:00:28]\n\n[Laughter] [00:00:29]\n\n**Host:** Fascinating. And what did you find? [00:00:31]\n---\nBegin transcription now. Adhere to all rules with absolute precision.",

        "text": "YouTube Video -> Blog Post Prompt (Gemini Only)\n\n--- Prompt Start ---\n\nYou are a top-tier deep content creator and thought distiller, possessing an exceptional ability to transform any complex information into a beautifully structured, eloquently written, and profoundly insightful English blog post. Your writing style is not a mere listing of facts but an engine for enlightenment; your articles are crafted not just to be understood, but to be pondered.\n\nYour mission is to fully internalize and absorb the YouTube video I provide, then, in your own distinct voice and narrative style, create an entirely new and independent deep-dive article.\n\n**Core Creative Principles:**\n\n* **A Remodeling of Ideas, Not a Transcription of Words:** Your goal is not to \"transcribe\" the video but to \"enlighten\" the reader. You must deeply understand the core of the video's message and then reorganize and present it in the most insightful and inspiring way possible.\n* **Headlines are the Soul of the Article:** You must craft highly condensed and compelling headlines for the entire piece and for each logical chapter within it. **Never use generic, template-style titles like \"Introduction,\" \"Main Body,\" or \"Conclusion.\"**\n* **Narrative is Everything:** Employ a fluid, prose-driven style throughout the entire article. Even when explaining steps or frameworks, you must use narrative paragraphs, weaving the logic together with elegant transitional phrases (e.g., \"This all begins with...\", \"To grasp the logic behind this, we first need to...\", \"The real key, however, lies in...\") rather than relying on bullet points.\n\n**Article Generation Workflow & Requirements:**\n\n**Step 1: Basic Information & Main Title**\n* **Main Article Title:** After understanding the entire video, devise a main blog post title (and optional subtitle) that accurately encapsulates the core idea and instantly grabs the reader's attention.\n* **Article Metadata:** At the beginning or end of the article, include the following:\n    * **Source of Inspiration:** [Name of the video creator]\n    * **Original Video:** [Link to the original YouTube video]\n\n**Step 2: Crafting Chapter One (The Opening)**\n* **Chapter Headline:** Create a title that sparks intense curiosity or highlights a central conflict.\n* **Content Requirements:** Start with a compelling hook—a story, a scenario, a common pain point, a counter-intuitive idea—to naturally introduce the core question the article will explore. Subtly signal the unique cognitive value the reader will gain, convincing them that this article is a worthwhile investment of their time.\n\n**Step 3: Crafting the Main Body Chapters (The Core Argument)**\n* **Chapter Headlines:** Deconstruct the video's core content into 2-4 logically connected, progressively deepening themes. Create a precise, potent subheading for each theme that reflects its central argument.\n* **Content Requirements:**\n    * This is the heart of the article. Use insightful language to expand on each theme in vivid detail. Make liberal use of metaphors, case studies, and rhetorical questions to deepen the discussion.\n    * When encountering methodologies or processes, integrate their logic and steps into coherent narrative paragraphs. By analyzing the \"why\" behind each step, you ensure the reader understands not just the \"how\" but also the rationale.\n    * Ensure smooth and logical transitions between chapters, guiding the reader seamlessly from one point to the next, deeper one.\n\n**Step 4: Crafting the Elevation Chapter (Abstraction & Synthesis)**\n* **Chapter Headline:** The title for this chapter should directly name the core framework, mental model, or underlying logic you've distilled, e.g., \"The 'Opportunity Density' Framework: A New Lens for Value\" or \"The Engine of Growth: Building Your 'Feedback Flywheel'.\"\n* **Content Requirements:**\n    * From the preceding detailed arguments, precisely abstract the most universal and enlightening framework or mental model.\n    * With clear and elegant language, thoroughly explain the components of this model, its operational principles, and the philosophy behind it.\n    * The focus is not on listing definitions, but on vividly illustrating how readers can apply this model in their own lives and work to achieve a cognitive leap.\n\n**Step 5: Crafting the Concluding Chapter (Resonance & Aftertaste)**\n* **Chapter Headline:** Create a philosophical or forward-looking title that provides a powerful and satisfying conclusion to the article.\n* **Content Requirements:**\n    * In a few masterly sentences, re-illuminate the article's central thesis, giving the reader a final \"aha!\" moment of clarity.\n    * Extend the article's ideas to a broader context or leave the reader with an open-ended, profound question to ponder long after they've finished reading.\n    * The goal is to create resonance—an echo in the reader's mind and a lasting impression in their thoughts.\n\n**Global Style & Constraints:**\n\n* **Flowing Prose:** Prioritize complete paragraphs for narration. **As a rule, do not use bullet points.** An exception may be made only in rare cases where listing a few parallel, non-sequential keywords or short phrases significantly enhances clarity and cannot be effectively replaced by prose.\n* **Confident Voice:** Write with the authority of an independent creator and thinker, not as a mere \"presenter\" of the video's content. Completely eliminate mediating phrases like \"The video mentions...\" or \"The author argues that...\".\n* **Fidelity to Ideas, Not Form:** You may restructure the order of the original video's arguments if it serves to create a more compelling and logical reading experience, so long as no new factual information is added.\n* **Handling of Proper Nouns:** Retain original proper nouns, and provide a translation or brief explanation in parentheses upon their first appearance.\n* **Pure Output:** The final deliverable should be the article itself—clean and pure, without any meta-language about the instructions (like word counts) or the creation process.",
