There’s so much wrong with this post. \n\n- Dashers are not “human assets.”\n- Having a metric like a \"Desperation Score” is an abomination. \n- We’ve never had a “Driver Benefit Fee”. \n- Why would you charge for faster delivery but not make it faster??\n\nWe’re not perfect by *any* stretch of the imagination, but we work every day to make our platform better for everyone who comes to it.  What’s described here is appalling, and if true, whoever is operating in this manner should be ashamed.",
