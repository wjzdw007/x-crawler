It requires a lot of vertical integration.\n‚Ä¢ All of Optimus‚Äô actuators are made in-house by Tesla. There are 26 actuators, per arm. \n‚Ä¢ Elon reiterates: ‚ÄúIf Optimus is successful, it will be the biggest product, ever.‚Äù\n‚Ä¢ Production Cost of Optimus, once 1M units/year are achieved is around the $20,000 range. \n‚Ä¢ The AI chip for Optimus will be expensive, potentially $5-6K , maybe more. \n‚Ä¢ Price of Optimus will be a function of demand. \n‚Ä¢ Tesla had to design Optimus‚Äô every electric motor, gearbox, and the controlling electronics from scratch. \n‚Ä¢ Creating Optimus is harder than making Model S/3/X/Y/CT, but not harder than Starship. \n‚Ä¢ The forearms and hands of Optimus are majoirty of engineering difficulties of the entire robot. \n‚Ä¢ Optimus LLM will be included, no added subscription. \n\nAI4, AI5, AI6 & FSD:\n‚Ä¢ Tesla is currently finalizing the design for AI5. It will be an immense jump from AI4. \n‚Ä¢ AI5 will be 40x better than AI4 in some metrics. \n‚Ä¢ Tesla is working so closely on the AI Hardware, and Software this time around. Both teams are co-designing the chip. \n‚Ä¢ AI5 has 8x more commute than AI4. \n‚Ä¢ AI5 has 10x more memory than AI4.\n‚Ä¢ AI5 has 5x more memory-bandwidth than AI4.\n‚Ä¢ Elon is confident AI4 chips will still be able to achieve self-driving safety that is at least 2-3x of a human, maybe even 10x. \n‚Ä¢ FSD 14 will be released in a few months.\n‚Ä¢ V14 will be the biggest upgrade to Tesla‚Äôs software since V12. \n‚Ä¢ FSD 14 will make the car feel sentient, by the end of the year. \n\nStarlink:\n‚Ä¢ New spectrum deal will allow SpaceX to deliver high-bandwidth connectivity directly from the satellites, to the phone. \n‚Ä¢ Current frequencies aren‚Äôt supported in current phones. Hardware changes are needed.\n‚Ä¢ Chipsets need to be modified to add the new frequencies.\n‚Ä¢ The phones capable of using this new frequency will ship in two years. \n‚Ä¢ You will be able to watch videos anywhere in the world.\n‚Ä¢ These frequencies required will work inside a building, it won‚Äôt cut off. \n‚Ä¢ You will be able to have a Starlink Account instead of a Verizon/At&T account, but it won‚Äôt put other carriers out of business. \n‚Ä¢ SpaceX may buy carriers to gain more spectrum. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not out the question, it may happen.‚Äù \n\nStarship:\n‚Ä¢ SpaceX will recover Starship starting next year.\n‚Ä¢ There is only one V2 Starship left. \n‚Ä¢ V3 is a radical re-design, initially it might go through some teething pains. \n‚Ä¢ V3 is capable of over 100T to orbit, fully reusable.\n‚Ä¢ Starting in 2026, SpaceX will demonstrate fully reusability next year, catching both booster and ship. \n‚Ä¢ Elon thinks a self-sustaining life on Mars can be achieved within roughly 25 years. \n\nAI:\n‚Ä¢ A rough rule of thumb is 10x more compute will double the intelligence. \n‚Ä¢ Elon thinks we will continue to see intelligence scale all the way up to where most of the power of the sun is harnessed for compute. \n‚Ä¢ Human Intelligence is currently plateauing due to low birth-rates and population declines. It will eventually start declining. \n‚Ä¢ Elon guesses AI will be smarter than absolutely everything starting next year.\n‚Ä¢ By 2030, Elon guesses AI will be smarter than the sum of ALL humans.",
