        "text": "(Warning: long rant)\n\nMy liberal friends are completely oblivious about how radicalizing the last week has been for tens of millions of normal Americans. Zero clue.\n\nI‚Äôm not talking about people who are ‚Äúonline‚Äù; I mean regular, everyday Americans. ‚ÄúNormies.‚Äù People who scroll through Facebook posts and Instagram reels from the Dutch Bros drive thru line. Political moderates who have water cooler chats about Mahomes touchdowns and Bon Jovi concerts, not Twitter threads or Rachel Maddow monologues.\n\nMillions of them. Tens of millions. They‚Äôre logging on, they‚Äôre engaging, and they‚Äôre furious.\n\nAnd I‚Äôll be candid: They blame you guys. They blame the left.\n\nRegardless of whether you believe it to be justified, they think you‚Äôre the bad guys here. And they are reacting accordingly.\n\nI can already hear some of you racing toward the comments to start screeching in moral indignation, so I‚Äôm going to be blunt: Shut up and listen to what I‚Äôm telling you. Your movement will lose any semblance of relevance if you don‚Äôt develop some small measure of self-awareness, and‚Äîabsent someone force-feeding you bitter medicine‚Äîyou guys collectively lack the humility to do this on your own.\n\nHere are the facts:\n\nFact 1. Tens of millions of Americans started the week seeing a 23-year-old blonde woman‚Äîa young woman in whom virtually every parent watching pictured their own daughter‚Äîstabbed in the neck by a career criminal. These people then found out the murderer had been released from jail 14 times over.\n\nFact 2. Two days later, tens of millions of Americans watched a video of Charlie Kirk get murdered speaking to college students. Millions of these people knew who Charlie was; millions of them didn‚Äôt. Upon seeing the video, however, these normal Americans from across the land and across the political spectrum agreed that he was the victim of a terrible, fundamentally unjustifiable crime, and their hearts broke in sympathy for his family. Good people who had never even heard the name Charlie Kirk before wept.\n\nFact 3. Immediately after seeing the footage of a peaceful young man get shot in the neck, these same people logged onto Facebook and Instagram (remember, we are talking about regular Americans, not perpetually online Twitter or Bluesky users) and saw some of their local nurses, school teachers, college administrators, and retail workers celebrating this horrific crime. Not just defending it, but cheering it.\n\nThese are all facts. You may not like the implications of these facts, and we can certainly debate the underlying causes thereof, but, indisputably, they are nevertheless factual statements.\n\nHere‚Äôs what it means for you, the Democrats reading this:\n\nThese normal, middle-of-the-road, non-political citizens just become politically active. They realized that politics cares about them, even if they don‚Äôt particularly care about politics. After watching Iryna Zarutska and Charlie Kirk both bleed out from the neck, they think their lives and the physical safety of their families‚Äîthe bedrock of human society, the foundation of Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs‚Äîdepend on political activation, whether they desire it or not.\n\nThese people are now sprinting‚Äînot jogging, not walking, but racing‚Äîto the right. Because they blame you guys for everything that just happened.\n\nWhen they see footage of Decarlos Brown stabbing a Ukrainian refugee to death, they don‚Äôt see just one demon-possessed man. They picture every university administrator, HR bureaucrat, and DEI apparatchik that ever lectured them about systemic racism, the ‚Äúcarceral state,‚Äù or the need to release violent crime suspects without bail in the name of social justice.\n\nThey then think back to conversations they‚Äôve had with their cop friends‚Äîtheir buddy from high school who quit the force after getting tired of being called a racist, their friend at the local YMCA who vents about having to release career criminals because Soros-funded prosecutors aren‚Äôt willing to file charges‚Äîand they realize everything the left has told them over the last five years has been utter bullshit.\n\nAnd they blame you. Because, even if you count yourself as a moderate Democrat, your party supported the district attorneys, city council members, and mayors that let fictitious concerns about mental health and racial justice supersede very real concerns for their family‚Äôs safety.\n\nWhen these Americans see blood erupt from the side of Charlie Kirk‚Äôs neck, they don‚Äôt see just a martyred political activist. They think of every extreme leftist they‚Äôve ever met who (1) calls anyone to the right of Hillary Clinton a fascist and (2) constantly jokes‚Äî‚Äújokes‚Äù‚Äîabout punching Nazis and ‚Äúbashing the fash.‚Äù\n\nThey realize that there really do exist people who wish to see them dead for their moderately conservative political beliefs, their Christian faith, and even the color of their skin. They ask themselves if the violence visited upon Charlie might one day show up on their own doorstep.\n\nAnd they blame you. Because, even if you‚Äôre just a center-of-the-road liberal, you lacked the courage to police your own ranks. You let modern-day Maoist red guards run loose across every facet of society, and what started with social-media struggle sessions has now turned to 30-06 bullet holes.\n\nWhen these Americans log onto social media and see their neighbors justifying, celebrating, glorifying murder, they realize that some who walk among them are soulless ghouls at best, literally demon-possessed at worst. These people‚Äîwhether they faithfully attend church every Sunday or only attend with relatives once a year, on Christmas Eve‚Äîstart talking about things like spiritual warfare. They implicitly understand that no normal human casually celebrates the mortal demise of a peaceful person.\n\nAnd they blame you. Because, even if you condemned Charlie Kirk‚Äôs murder, they probably haven‚Äôt seen you condemn those in your own movement who cheered it on. They view you as complicit in allowing heartless fellow travelers to celebrate death, and it repulses them.\n\nFor all of these situations, what has your response been? Nothing but bullshit.\n\nIn response to Iryna Zarutska bleeding out on the floor of a train, you post bullshit statistics about reductions in reported crime, when everyone who‚Äôs ever been to a major urban center in the last decade knows that actual crime has skyrocketed, only for victims not to waste their time reporting it to cops that don‚Äôt have the manpower to respond and prosecutors that seek to downgrade as many felonies as possible to misdemeanor citations.\n\nIn response to a 31-year-old man taking a bullet to the neck in front of his family, you post nothing but bullshit whataboutism.\n\n> ‚ÄúWhat about January 6th?‚Äù (Honest answer: After you let Liz Cheney spend two years operating a star chamber in the House, combined with countless other failed attempts at ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù against Trump, no one cares anymore.)\n\n> ‚ÄúWhat about Mike Lee making a dumb joke on Twitter about some guy in a mask in Minnesota?‚Äù (No one outside of Utah, DC, or Twitter knows who Mike Lee even is.)\n\n> ‚ÄúWhat about Paul Pelosi?‚Äù (That‚Äôs not comparable to Charlie Kirk getting shot, and we all know it. And, again, Paul who?)\n\n> ‚ÄúWhat about regulations on assault rifles?‚Äù (That‚Äôs not going to get you very far when one of these killers used a knife and the other one used a common hunting rifle.)\n\nIn response to teachers, healthcare workers, and thousands of other liberals cheering on Charlie‚Äôs murder, it‚Äôs nothing but more bullshit and misdirection.\n\n> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not THAT many people celebrating!‚Äù (Yes, it is. Everyone has seen it on their Facebook and Instagram feeds.)\n\n> ‚ÄúI thought you guys didn‚Äôt support cancel culture.‚Äù (We don‚Äôt cancel people over their opinions; we‚Äôre more than happy to see people lose their jobs‚Äîespecially their taxpayer-funded jobs‚Äîfor actively cheering on murder, though. If you can‚Äôt see the difference, that‚Äôs your own shortcoming.)\n\nAll bullshit. Not even smart bullshit, but stale, mid-grade, low-IQ bullshit. Ordinary Americans see right through it, and they don‚Äôt like how it smells.\n\nYou probably don‚Äôt like hearing this. But you need to hear it.\n\nBecause I‚Äôm right, and, as you reflect on this, you know I‚Äôm right. The ranks of my political movement gained millions of righteously angry new members this week. We have a mandate to ensure these crimes never happen again, and that‚Äôs exactly what we are now going to do.\n\nIf you want to keep a seat at the table as we do so, you‚Äôd better clean house and start policing your own.",
