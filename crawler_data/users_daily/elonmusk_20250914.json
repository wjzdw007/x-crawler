They ask why.\n\n\"Well, you see, he was evil!\" they cry gleefully, eyes feral.\n\nThe normie just stares a the screen. A clean cut guy with a microphone is bleeding out horrifically. It reminds them of the scared young blonde they saw bleeding out on the subway just a few days ago. A question forms. \n\n\"What did he do that made him evil?\" they ask.\n\n\"He SAID things!\" they scream back, a bit of spittle flying from their mouths.\n\n\"So you are happy they murdered him....for talking?\"\n\n\"YESSSS!!!! You get it now!\" claps their kids teacher, their pilot, or their doctor.\n\nThe normie is horrified. Someone they trust their kids to, their health to, or their safety is acting like a foaming, raging lunatic who wants people dead because they said something they didn't like.\n\nDo you realize how this comes across?",

Members may submit signatures in support of the motion via email, once the motion has been officially posted. \n\nOnce 150 signatures are reached, this will trigger a vote of no confidence, in which all members will be able to vote. \n\nI expect this to occur on the weekend of the 18th of October. This will be an in-person vote only, so if you wish to participate you will need to travel to Oxford if you are not currently there.",

A ruse? A clever masterplan, hiding his true evil bigoted face, & all these people have fallen for it?\n\nBecause that seems not only far-fetched & paranoid but rather condescending, infantilising, an act of removing agency from people of the marginalised groups you fetishise because they do not agree with you...one might say racist, homophobic, & misogynistic.\n\nThe other thing I see are videos of Charlie Kirk himself, again & again saying we have to talk to each other, respectfully, despite our differences, otherwise we foster a culture which will lead to violence...is this what a fascist does?\n\nBecause I do not think so, I think the fascists are the ones who kill their political opponents to stop them having a voice.",

To put that in perspective, TPUSA currently has 900 official college chapters and around 1,200 high school chapters, with a presence on 3,500 total. Charlie's vision to have a Club America chapter (our high school brand) in every high school in America (around 23,000) will come true much much faster than he could have ever possibly imagined.\n\nTruly incredible.",

        "text": "Teachers unions have become one of the pipelines of political radicalization in this country, and they need to be called out for it.\n\nTake Randi Weingarten. She's not only the president of the American Federation of Teachers, she also sits on the board of the National Democratic Institute (NDI), the Democratic Party's foreign policy arm for running regime change and soft power operations abroad. Recently, she announced a \"partnership\" with the World Economic Forum on behalf of our children.\n\nThink about what that means. The head of a domestic teachers' union is also plugged into Washington's machinery for destabilizing governments overseas, and she has the unilateral power to decide which global institutions get to shape American classrooms.\n\nThat is not an accident. Powerful technocratic forces have leveraged themselves in positions of power that decide what your children learn, precisely because they want to make faithful foot soldiers of your children without your consent.",
