You only need a simple majority in the house to impeach any judge.  \n\nOnce impeached, it goes to the senate where you need 67 votes to remove them.  \n\nIn other words, the House can impeach every one of these leftist loons tomorrow of they wanted to.  \n\nBy doing so, these judges will have to defend their ruling before the senate and the people.  Granted most won't be removed, but the process will be its own punishment, and it will stop most of these  crazy rulings.",

        "text": "10 drives in with FSD v14.1 and here are all my thoughts. \n\nFirst of all- wow. Zero disengagements or interventions thus far. The confidence and overall human like driving is next level. The steering inputs are so smooth, braking inputs are earlier and more linear than before. \n\nIt gives off Robotaxi vibes with how it navigates parking lots, plus how it drives and how quickly it backs into a parking spot. Such a nice experience to ride along with it. \n\nSeeing FSD now navigate parking garages is so cool. When you enter it waits for the arm to open after you get your ticket, proceeds in and finds a parking space. When you leave it does the same thing, gets close to the ticket stand and then proceeds. Really fascinating to see in person. \n\nIt really sometimes feels like FSD can now read signs in the garage to guide it to the exit. Brought it to the back corner of a garage and it found its way out. \n\nHurry mode is awesome, quick and more assertive than before, while also being smoother with less unnecessary lane changes. Sloth mode is what you‚Äôd expect- exact speed limit and gentle driving. Icons are cool and easy to change. When you start FSD from park, there‚Äôs no delay. It starts right away and leaves in a split second. Really good improvement. \n\nI love being able to select the Arrival Options if I am parking curbside or in a charger, it also automatically  chooses depending on where you navigate to. \n\nIt perfectly parks at Superchargers, tried it at the Tesla Diner and at the Santa Monica supercharger and both times it was excellent. Always centered in the lines and it parks better and quicker than the majority of humans do. \n\nOnly thing so far to note is one instance of slight braking when going around a bus blocking a lane, was probably not even 1/2 of a second and dropped 1-2mph but felt it. Super super minor. \n\nHad FSD v14 move over for construction, a loose cone on a dark road, and obey a worker holding a stop sign. All of them were smooth and felt human like or better. \n\nIt pulls in and out of my driveway great, doesn‚Äôt hesitate at all as well as when at chargers. Everything has a quicker response time. Curbside is cool too as it pulls right up against the curb perfectly in a parking spot. \n\nThis release now means now 100% of your driving can now be done on FSD. From your driveway into a parking garage. Elon was right when he said it would feel sentient, and this isn‚Äôt even v14.2 yet.\n\nThe Tesla AI team COOKED with this update. It‚Äôs phenomenal. Huge congrats to them for such an epic release. This is a HUGE update and I can‚Äôt wait to drive it more. \n\nIt‚Äôs now 5am so I‚Äôm going to attempt to get some sleep, but tons more driving and videos coming later today as soon as I can. Thanks everyone for following along.",

        "text": "FSD 14 first impressions:\n\nthe good:\n- destination options are incredible and very well done. parking has been fast and flawless so far, zero corrections and right between the lines. also pulls into the driveways of houses very reliably and actually parks itself, feels like the freakin' future\n- V14 is always READY TO GO, if your car is in gear there is absolutely zero delay from pressing the \"Self-Driving\" button to when it actually takes off. feels like it's been considering what to do for a lifetime and you finally let it free lol, SUPER fast\n- it squeezes gaps that V13 would never go for (see my narrow gate video for an example) and also just generally feels like it's never wondering what to do, it's always executing a maneuver and not pausing like V13\n- speed profiles feel pretty different now (in a good way), although I'm pretty sure the new \"sloth\" mode just lowers the max speed to the detected speed limit which artificially limits it (sometimes feels like it wants to drive faster even in sloth mode but can't)\n- there's a particular wide road with a 25mph speed limit near me that V13 would speed 10+ mph on very consistently, V14 did 5mph over on \"standard\" profile which is a big improvement\n- it seems like it tries to stay within the lane lines much better than V13, which is technically the correct and legal thing to do but can sometimes make it feel slightly more jerky during turning. I had the same feedback in my Robotaxi rides. overall a positive though, it's definitely staying further away from curbs and not cutting corners like V13 sometimes would\n- U-turns have absolutely never been handled better, I did a bunch for testing and it handled them all flawlessly even in the dark where the lights didn't light up some of the drivable space. felt like it remembered what it saw from the headlights in the moments before and just went for it\n- I'm not sure if they updated the maps, but several places where the car did the wrong thing on V13 (like use wrong turning lane for incorrect address in navigation), V14 no longer does. I had 3 spots I was super excited to test and it passed 2/3 (the one that wasn't fixed wasn't a disengagement, it just went around the block and did a U-turn that was not necessary)\n- I feel like I have not gotten even close to stress testing this, which I feel like I have to point out in the \"good\" section because man, it's crazy how far we've come. I was thinking about this a lot during the drive as it went through several areas where older versions would struggle with every time\n- the car feels much more sentient, as others have described. you can definitely feel V14 \"considering\" a lot more when it's driving about its surroundings which is usually a great thing, but sometimes not (which I will explain below)\n\nthe bad:\n- had two minor braking events that happened very quickly (was probably only braking a total of 1/10 of a second) but felt pretty harsh. like a quick jab of the brakes before going back to regular driving. both times it did this I was messing with the navigation route, but still startled me a bit\n- had a moment where it tried to pull over to the side of the road for a moment due to someone approaching us behind with super blue headlights. it never actually pulled over, but signaled and started to go off the road, then immediately changed its mind and continued\n- I chose two impossible destinations, the first was behind a fence and it just reversed all the way back out into the road and did several u-turns before arriving at the same spot each time, stuck in an infinite loop. the second was a destination pin slightly behind a closed road where it technically could have gone around, but didn't and instead stopped at the nearest stop sign and shifted itself into park (better than an infinite loop I suppose)\n- there's a new message on screen that says \"Increased attention required\" that pops up whenever you approach a construction zone or RR crossing (possibly for other stuff too), but I feel like it's actually distracting. it appears suddenly and makes me take my eyes off the road to see what it says, which is probably the opposite of what they want. I think a subtle blue glow like before or maybe a sound would be better\n\noverall, super impressed and can't wait to actually stress test tomorrow. seems like @tesla_ai absolutely cooked here and it seriously feels like a robotaxi with some of the features they've added. they've fixed SO many things in my local area, which I'll talk about in my first impressions video\n\ngn everyone",

Prior to receiving the Neuralink, he was diagnosed with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degredation of upper and lower motor neurons.\n\nNeuralink's first clinical trial called the PRIME Study allows him and other paralyzed individuals to regain *digital* independence by moving a mouse cursor with just their mind. Now, the CONVOY Study allows them to regain *physical* independence by controlling this arm as well.\n\n\"It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life so far. I spent Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday working with the Assistive Robotic Arm (ARA) team operating the ARA with my Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)... I put on my own hat for the first time in years! I microwaved my own chicken nuggets and fed myself!\"\n\nSoon enough, we'll be seeing Neuralink patients control an Optimus robot, or even an army of Optimi!",
