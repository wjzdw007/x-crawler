People must know the names of those who try to steal their freedoms:\n\nToday, the European Union nearly banned your right to privacy. It was set to vote on a law that would force apps to scan every private message, turning everyone‚Äôs phone into a spying tool.\n\nFrance led the push for this authoritarian law. Both former and current Interior Ministers, Bruno Retailleau and Laurent Nu√±ez, supported it. Last March, they declared that police should see French citizens‚Äô private messages. The Republicans and Macron‚Äôs Renaissance group voted for it.\n\nSuch measures are supposed to ‚Äúfight crime‚Äù, but their real target is regular people. It wouldn‚Äôt stop criminals ‚Äî they could just use VPNs or special websites to hide. Officials‚Äô and police messages wouldn‚Äôt be scanned either, since the law conveniently exempts them from surveillance. Only YOU ‚Äî ordinary citizens ‚Äî would face the danger of your private messages and photos being compromised.\n\nToday, we defended privacy: Germany‚Äôs sudden stand saved our rights. But freedoms are still threatened. While French leaders push for total access to private messages, the basic rights of French people ‚Äî and all Europeans ‚Äî remain in danger.",

While that development is not over, the future will see a matured Starship design whose reliability and robustness is critical to begin flying operational missions.\n\nIn the coming months and into 2026, SpaceX will aim to:\n\n- Complete Pad 2 at Starbase\n\n- Finish builds of the first Starship V3 hardware, which includes the upgraded Super Heavy booster and upper stage Starship\n\n- Demonstrate in-space propellant transfer as to refill Starship on-orbit, a critical feature of the overall infrastructure\n\n- Deploy payloads from Starship, including Starlink satellites\n\n- Return Starship to Starbase for catch by the tower just like Super Heavy\n\n- Re-fly Starship, demonstrating reusability of its heat shield\n\n- Begin flying missions from Florida\n\nThe most exciting time to be alive is now.",
