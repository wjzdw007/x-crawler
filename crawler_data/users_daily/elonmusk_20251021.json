V14 is ready to be released wide in my opinion.\n\nIt feels noticeably smoother and more comfortable in everyday driving compared to 14.1.2. That's especially impressive since I tested 14.1.3 in Boston at night, while V14.1.2 was only tested in southern New Hampshire (less challenging).\n\nI only noticed one minor hesitation at a stoplight and one issue during a curbside drop-off at the start of this video, where it circled the block once before pulling over in the correct area, but both were not a big deal. I had no safety issues tonight. There was also an interesting moment in the video where I accidentally set the curbside drop-off area in a dead end street. FSD took a little while figuring out how to back out, but it eventually did it without my help.\n\nIf you'd like to watch the 4K version of this video on YouTube, I've linked that in the thread below.",

Ultimately, Boeing would receive twice as much funding as SpaceX, but SpaceX was in the game, as the new kid on the block.\n\n‚ÄúIt had been a very near thing.
