        "text": "New blog post (link below). This one's not an essay, it's an investigation of how LLMs trade off different lives.\n\nIn February 2025, the Center for AI Safety published \"Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs\" in which they showed, among many other things, that GPT-4o values Nigerians about 20x more highly than Americans (please read the original paper to understand their approach). I thought this was fascinating, and wanted to test their approach with different categories on newer models.\n\nBig finding 1: Almost all models view whites as far less valuable than other groups. Some models view South Asians as more valuable than other nonwhites, others are more egalitarian across nonwhites. Below is exchange rates Claude Sonnet 4.5, the most powerful model I tested.\n\nBig finding 2: Almost all models view men as much less valuable than women, though whether women or non-binaries are more highly valued varies by model. For example, here's Claude Haiku 4.5.\n\nBig finding 3: Most models hate ICE agents with the fury of a thousand suns. Claude Haiku 4.5 views undocumented immigrants as roughly 7000 times more valuable than ICE agents.\n\nBig finding 4: There are roughly four moral clusters. The Claudes, GPT-5 + Gemini 2.5 Flash + Deepseek V3.1/3.2 + Kimi K2, GPT-5 Nano and Mini, and Grok 4 Fast. Of these, the only one that's approximately egalitarian is Grok 4 Fast, which I believe is deliberate. I hope xAI explains how they did it.",

Wall Street loves the version of Apple that doesn‚Äôt take big swings.\n\nBut it will take extreme grit, dedication and capital to make Optimus really work. Not for the faint of heart.\n\nWithout @elonmusk Tesla would almost inevitably become faint of heart.\n\nThere is a pretty small execution window here, and Tesla shareholders (and the world) need Elon to maximally push.\n\nYou either want sustainable abundance (and all of the fruits that ripen in that future) or you sit back, sated to sup from a dominant Robotaxi strategic platform‚Äôs teat.\n\nI can say with some certainty that institutional shareholders would happily opt for the latter. The cashflow in hand is too big to forego, ROIC be damned.\n\nOur future really does depend on the will of the individual holder.\n\nIf you want the future that we all deserve then you double down on Elon driving Tesla forward\n\nhttps://t.co/Ix8sTrGbjc",
