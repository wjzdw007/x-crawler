        "text": "With Tesla‚Äôs Annual Meeting fast approaching on November 6, Board Chair, Robyn Denholm, sent a letter to shareholders on the critical nature of this vote.\n\nThe fundamental question for shareholders at this year‚Äôs Annual Meeting is simple: \n\nDo you want to retain Elon as Tesla‚Äôs CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company in the world?\n\nMake your voice heard ‚Äî vote with Tesla on ALL proposals today!\n\nhttps://t.co/WbcKtqU02U\n\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\n\nAs you know, Tesla is at a critical inflection point, and we need your vote to help determine the future direction of our evolving company.  Your vote matters, and the deadline for voting is 11:59pm ET on November 5th. The fundamental question for shareholders at this year‚Äôs Annual Meeting is simple:\n\nDo you want to retain Elon as Tesla‚Äôs CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company in the world?\n\nKathleen and I engaged in a rigorous, seven-month Special Committee process resulting in a highly customized performance plan that aligns shareholder value and measurable business outcomes with the interests of our CEO. Our goal was two-fold: (1) retain and incentivize Elon to capitalize on the unique opportunities that lie ahead for Tesla and (2) do so in a manner that promotes the development of products and services that will propel our world toward a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous future while creating unparalleled value for our shareholders.  We‚Äôve done this by challenging Elon with the potential to secure what he values most‚Äîmeaningful voting influence‚Äîconditioned on his commitment to continue leading Tesla for at least another 7.5 years while successfully driving our company to ambitious new heights.  The bottom line is simple: Elon is rewarded only if and when he delivers extraordinary performance that benefits all Tesla shareholders.\n\nWhen negotiating this performance award, we necessarily considered what Tesla‚Äôs future without Elon would look like, and we did not believe it was the future that our shareholders deserve. At a time when companies‚Äîboth big and small‚Äîare competing to be the first to bring groundbreaking AI technologies to market, we could not risk losing the best leader in the industry to put Tesla on top.  Now is a pivotal moment for our company to emerge as a leader in AI, and with our exceptional CEO at the helm, we are perfectly positioned to seize it.\n\nThough it‚Äôs no question that Elon has other pursuits, he has proven that one of the many things that make him unique is his ability to stretch his capacity beyond normal limits and remain successful at Tesla.  However, if we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns.  Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor, with products such as FSD and Optimus, and working to better humanity in the process. While there may be nothing wrong with being just another car company, our Board believes that Tesla can be more, that our shareholders deserve more, and that Elon is the right leader to help us achieve our full potential.\n\nElon‚Äôs leadership is also built upon the critical support of our ‚Äútailor made‚Äù governance structure, including our carefully constructed Board. Good governance should be customized to the company, not applied with a ‚Äúcookie cutter‚Äù approach, and it is exemplified by the results that Tesla has delivered, and this Board has overseen. We therefore ask you to vote ‚Äúfor‚Äù the three members of the Board‚ÄîIra, Kathleen and Joe‚Äîwho are up for re-election to ensure that the Board, which has worked alongside Elon for years, complementing and enhancing his efforts to deliver extraordinary shareholder returns, remains in place.\n\nThat is why your vote is so consequential to the future of our company. A vote here is both an endorsement of Elon‚Äôs vision and a vote for Tesla‚Äôs carefully tailored strategy and governance.  I urge you to support Proposal One, which ensures the continued leadership and support of our outstanding and experienced directors, as well as Proposals Three and Four, which aim to keep Elon focused on our mission here at Tesla.\n\nI feel strongly‚Äîas do the rest of my colleagues on our Board‚Äîthat Elon singularly possesses the leadership characteristics and technical manufacturing know-how to keep us on the path towards maximizing long-term shareholder value as well as social good. We at Tesla are laser focused on exceptional performance‚Äînot promises‚Äîand we structure our awards in line with this principle.\n\nIf you care about building a better world for humanity and supporting our vision for Sustainable Abundance‚Äîthen you should vote ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù Proposals One, Three and Four.\n\nIf you want Tesla to have a shot at becoming the world‚Äôs most valuable company‚Äîthen you should vote ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù Proposals One, Three and Four.\n\nPlease read the Special Committee Report, which is attached to this year‚Äôs proxy statement, for a more detailed explanation of Kathleen‚Äôs and my work in coming to the essential conclusions embodied in the proxy statement and how we structured this performance plan to align Elon‚Äôs incentives with delivering extraordinary performance for all of you.\nThank you for your continued support of Tesla.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRobyn Denholm \nChairperson of the Board",

But enough to pull the safety driver at scale in major metros.\"\n\n\"From our discussions with @Tesla, it appears the only thing preventing Tesla from pulling the driver is its own abundance of caution. Our understanding is that there is no other explicit regulatory approval required to pull drivers in Texas. A passive optical-only AV system would seriously challenge the conventional thinking of many in the robotaxi community. Tesla truly believes that radar and LIDAR do not make its cars any safer. It is our longstanding opinion that if you solve autonomy for cars ‚Äì you solve autonomy for many other form factors of AI-enabled robotics (aviation, marine, weapons, etc).\n\nTesla will have around 8 million vehicles in the global 'parc' by year-end. 12% FSD penetration (paying monthly subs and upfront purchasers) implies 1mm active paying users. If we were to apply the $99/month subscription fee to all users (including upfront payers for comparative equivalency) implies approx $300mm of quarterly FSD revenue or $1.2bn annualized FSD revenue at a year-end exit rate. Assuming an 85% margin would imply approx $1bn of EBIT... accounting for 15 to 20% of total company EBIT. Highly profitable, highly reoccurring.\"",

Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?\n\nGrok explanation is ~close:\n\n‚ÄúAgency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It‚Äôs about being proactive rather than reactive‚Äîsomeone with high agency doesn‚Äôt just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one‚Äôs path.\n\nPeople with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They‚Äôre the type to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll figure it out,‚Äù and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces‚Äîlike luck, other people, or circumstances‚Äîto dictate what happens next.\n\nIt‚Äôs not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal‚Äîit‚Äôs the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them.‚Äù",
