        "text": "NEWS: The State Board of Administration of Florida, which owns $1.23 billion of $TSLA stock, says it is voting FOR Elon Musk's 2025 CEO Performance Award on Nov 6th.\n\n\"If the 2025 CEO performance award achieves its intended outcomes, it would mark one of the most remarkable examples of performance-based compensation driving shareowner value in modern corporate history. For shareowners, it would validate a bold governance strategy that aligns leadership incentives with long-term growth. For the investment world, it would set a precedent for how visionary leadership, paired with ambitious yet measurable goals, can deliver outsized returns and reshape expectations around executive pay and corporate performance.\n\nCritics of the 2025 Tesla Performance Award often overlook the simple fact that this exact model of incentive compensation has already proven itself twice over. The 2018 plans were derided in almost identical terms (\"excessive,\" \"outsized\") yet both drove extraordinary shareholder returns. The 2012 package, contingent on a tenfold increase in market capitalization, was achieved years ahead of schedule.\n\nThe 2018 award, which ISS and Glass Lewis have criticized, required Tesla to grow from roughly $50 billion to $650 billion in market cap; growth that was accomplished within only four years, creating hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder wealth. In both cases, the dilution effect was minimal compared to the immense value creation for investors. Musk only benefited when shareholders benefited first. The same dynamic underpins the 2025 award. \n\nThe milestones are extraordinarily demanding as they require Tesla to become an $8.5 trillion enterprise and to achieve operational breakthroughs in autonomy, robotics, and energy storage. For shareowners, this represents an upside bet: as Tesla achieves each of the targets in the plan, investors enjoy a significant gain in value. This is not moral hazard, it's alignment. Those who claim the plan is \"too large\" ignore the scale of ambition that has historically defined Tesla's trajectory. A company that went from near-bankruptcy to global leadership in EVs and clean energy under similar frameworks has earned the right to use incentive models that reward moonshot performance.\n\nConclusion:\nTesla's performance-based CEO compensation plans have consistently driven extraordinary shareowner value, far outpacing industry peers and market benchmarks. The proposed 2025 plan continues this tradition, aligning executive rewards with ambitious, measurable milestones that benefit all shareowners. With robust governance safeguards, transparent succession planning, and a proven track record of value creation, we believe this plan sets the gold standard or executive compensation.\n\nFor these reasons, among others, the SBA will be voting FOR the 2025 CEO Performance Award at the Annual General Meeting to be held on November 6, 2025.\"",
