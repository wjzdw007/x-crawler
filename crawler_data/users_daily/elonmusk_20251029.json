That seems like a pretty significant asset.”\n\nSo basically, each car has ~1 kilowatt of high-performance AI inference capability, Tesla wouldn’t need to build giant data centers — the fleet is the data center. \n\nTesla could turn their entire fleet into a giant distributed inference network, spread across the world, powered by the batteries and AI in the car already.\n\nMind blown.",

Tesla's progress in robotics would benefit from xAI's\nprogress in AGI.

All in on AfD. From frustrated Gen Z to eye-rolling mid-career professionals, the message is clear: the old establishment’s playlist is on skip.\n\nEven 18–29 year olds are leaning AfD, edging out the CDU and nearly tying Die Linke, yes, the far-left. Apparently, irony is alive and well.\n\nThe only demographic not buying in? Boomers. The last loyalists to the era of stability, newspapers, and actual phone calls.\n\nOne analyst put it best: “A few years ago, this was unthinkable. Now?
