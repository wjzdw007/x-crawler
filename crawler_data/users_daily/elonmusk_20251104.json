Please reach out via email, the mobile app message center, phone, or X DM.\n\nHere’s why this is urgent: At least 6 of your ETF funds (around 7 million $TSLA shares) voted against Tesla’s board, and my 240,000+ Tesla investor followers are asking why Schwab would oppose one of the most successful corporate boards in history. Many of my followers are Schwab clients holding more shares than me (45,000 or more).\n\nAs a custodian of ETF shares, your fiduciary duty is to vote in shareholders’ best interests. For a board that has delivered extraordinary returns, voting against their recommendations doesn’t align with retail investors, Tesla employees, or the leadership we invested to support.\n\nIf Schwab’s proxy voting policies don’t reflect shareholder interests, my followers and I will move our collective tens of millions in $TSLA shares (or possibly hundreds of millions) to a broker that does, via account transfer as soon as this week. I’m not making empty threats - I am ready to move my shares now. The Tesla investor community is engaged and ready to act as well.",

Of course not.\n\nBecause they are not idiots; they do not tolerate suicidal empathy.\n\nThrough mass immigration, porous borders and a total failure to integrate newcomers, our leaders have made us much less safe and put our own people at risk\n\nThese migrants do not instantly adopt the host country's 'British' or 'English' culture and identity the moment they sign a few papers\n\nFar from it\n\nThey retain central aspects of their origin countries --including religion, belief, attitudes toward violence, hatred of non-believers, and so on \n\nThis is what the rape gang scandal was about; we imported clan-based networks from rural Pakistan that think non-believers are fair game and distrust authority  \n\nThe vast majority of radical Islamists in Britain were either born abroad or trace their roots back on these islands only one generation, while living in 'closed' social networks filled with other people from their origin countries, which reinforce these different cultures   \n\nThis is then further enabled by an idiotic ruling class and woke left that pursues virtue and social status for itself by proclaiming platitudes like \"diversity is a success\" while also having to use speech codes --\"far right\", \"racist\", and so on--to shut down any dissent\n\nThen it uses multiculturalism to encourage minorities to remain distinctive and separate from the majority, even prioritising them over the majority\n\nIt is all completely insane \n\nThis is what the UK has now been doing for 30 years, under Labour and the Tories, the Uniparty, importing radically different if not incompatible cultures which then persist across generations  \n\nAnd today this is being compounded by importing 180,000 unvetted illegal migrants into the country in just 7 years, with another 180,000 forecast to arrive by the next general election if the average trend continues \n\nJust think about that --by the next election we will be talking about 400,000 unvetted illegal migrants roaming around the country, many from the same highly violent, conflict-prone societies as the ones that have given us all of the chaos above \n\nAnd so in the years ahead this chaos will only increase, it will only get worse, because our leaders refuse to see this reality and make changes \n\nIn short, every terrorist attack, every stabbing, every rape, every sexual assault, every rape gangs, is a reminder of the fact our leaders, who are supposed to defend us, are importing people who hate who we are and cling to totally different cultures, identities, and outlooks, all of which is making our own culture, identity, and social cohesion harder to maintain  \n\nWe can either keep ignoring the critical importance of culture or we can do something about it\n\nWhat would \"doing something about it\" look like?\n\nRadically reshaping our country and its future around people who have deep roots and ties to this country\n\nRewarding those who genuinely integrate, removing those who do not\n\nEnding the extreme policy of mass uncontrolled immigration\n\nDoing whatever is necessary to fix our borders --leave ECHR, repeal HRA, detain and deport\n\nEnd soft-on-crime policies\n\nLaunch an all-out assault on radical, violent Islamism\n\nWe have a choice. We can do these things or we can keep killing ourselves from within.",

        "text": "Baron Capital Supports Elon Musk’s 2025 CEO Performance Award\n\nBaron Capital is in support of the proposed 2025 CEO Performance Award. We believe it reflects the same principles of accountability, performance and alignment with shareholder interests that drove Tesla’s past success. The plan ensures that shareholders win first, and that Elon Musk continues to lead Tesla for many years to come. We commend the Board for recognizing this and for working to retain Tesla’s most valuable asset. We believe the 2025 CEO Performance Award is right for the company, right for shareholders and right for the future.\n\nBaron Capital has been investing in @Tesla since 2014. Our shareholders and clients have benefited enormously from @elonmusk’s vision, determination and execution. Tesla’s success and its future are inseparable from Elon.\n\nElon is the ultimate “key man” of key man risk. Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla. He has built one of the most important companies in the world. He’s redefining transportation, energy and humanoid robotics and creating lasting value for shareholders while doing it. His interests are completely aligned with investors. He owns 13% of the company.\n\nWe will be voting FOR.\n\nSupplemental Information\n\nWhen my analyst team met with Elon Musk for two hours in our New York City office in 2010 during Tesla’s IPO roadshow, we thought his plans were more hopeful than plausible. Only one of our Funds made a small investment in Tesla at that time. But because Elon is a very impressive executive, we monitored Tesla closely for the next few years. Our research included several visits to Tesla's factories in Fremont, California and Reno, Nevada and frequent phone calls with Tesla executives including Elon. \n\nIn 2014 when sales of Model S began to increase significantly, I concluded we had been wrong thinking that Elon would not succeed. From 2014 to 2016 Baron Capital purchased approximately $400 million Tesla shares at prices that were about 13X higher than Tesla's IPO price! Tesla's shares have since increased more than 30X our purchase price in 2014. Baron Capital has earned about $8 billion profits realized and unrealized from our Tesla shares for our clients and proprietary accounts. \n\nWe began to purchase shares in another Musk business, @SpaceX, in 2017. We have invested about $1.3 billion to date in SpaceX. We have since earned about $4 billion profits realized and unrealized on those SpaceX purchases. Our recent $338 million investment in Elon's @xAI data center, social network and Grok AI, has produced about $340 million profits realized and unrealized to date. Profits earned from Musk-controlled businesses represent about 24% of the $52 billion profits we have earned for clients and proprietary accounts since 1992 when we managed $100 million in assets.\n\nMusk entities, due to their significant capital appreciation, now represent about 26% of our Firm's $44 billion AUM. We believe that Baron Capital could earn at least 5X the profits we have generated to date from the Musk ecosystem by 2035. If we are right, the beneficiaries of this success will be the estimated 1 million-plus working class and mass affluent, Baron mutual fund shareholders...their IRAs and 401(k) retirement accounts...as well as our institutional clients including endowments, foundations and sovereigns...and, looking through those entities, millions of additional individuals.\n\nFurther, we think the impact of our investments in Tesla is far greater than the amounts we manage directly. This belief is based on the fact that virtually every day when I am walking on the streets of New York City or in restaurants or traveling...people approach me to say, \"Thank you, Ron. You have changed my life!\" That is since, for the past twelve years, I have appeared on CNBC’s Squawk Box three or four times a year and have spoken about Tesla...and lately SpaceX, too...and investors have obviously been watching and listening.\n\nTesla's bonus contract with Elon has been written to achieve an objective to get Robotaxi and Optimus robots to scale. If successful, Tesla could earn $400 billion per year in adjusted EBITDA for an extended period by 2035. That could produce a market capitalization for Tesla of over $8 trillion. We believe by 2045 Tesla value could quadruple its 2035 levels. Tesla’s current market cap is $1.5 trillion. Elon will only achieve his full bonus payout if those objectives are met. Tesla shareholders benefit before he does by reaching aggressive market cap objectives that few believe can be attained. We think it is unlikely at this time anyone, but Elon could accomplish those objectives.\n\nWe believe Elon is not only perhaps the most extraordinary engineer on our planet but an unusually competent businessperson. If he did not live in this country, we think it improbable there would be electric cars...reusable space rockets...Starlink broadband satellites...self-driving cars...giant storage batteries that can be added to America's electric utility grid quickly to provide required energy for AI data centers’ growth in our country...a satellite system protecting our homeland...super-fast manufacturing lines...AI digitizing physical processes...and who knows what else...\n\nWe also deem it important that another element in Elon's bonus contract is succession. Tesla has 124,000 employees. The company hires only a small fraction of the millions of applicants from top engineering schools for Tesla engineering jobs. I found the comment of one Tesla Board member to me recently especially memorable: \"Other AI businesses hire mercenary engineers. Tesla hires brilliant young engineers and trains them. Why would they ever want to leave?\" Elon meets regularly with 30 to 40 engineers at a time in a room to discuss their work in various disciplines. And help solve problems they may be facing. Another Board member noted that when those employees leave the room, most are shaking their heads. The common refrain is that solutions to tasks they had thought unsolvable were outlined by Elon. On the fly. \"I can't believe what we are learning,\" was heard most often from the best and brightest.\n\nIt is rare that a senior executive challenges his prior assumptions recursively. Elon does. In my opinion, culture and people at Musk companies are unmatched at any publicly owned business I have visited in my 55-year career. That's because of him. From the large pool of awesome, talented engineers Elon is assembling, it should be possible to create an executive team to succeed Elon at some distant future point...if he ever decides he's done... If Elon ever leaves Tesla, we believe it's certainly not to sit on a beach somewhere drinking Mai Tai cocktails!  On Mars, maybe. But a beach in the Caribbean? No way.\n\nRon Baron (@RonBaronAnalyst)\nFounder \nCEO Baron Capital\nNovember 3, 2025\n\n______________________\n\nYou should consider the investment objectives, risk, charges, and expense of any of the Baron Funds carefully before investing.

I am also very grateful to @SecDuffy, who skillfully oversees @NASA alongside his many other responsibilities.\n\nThe support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming. I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\n\nTo the innovators building the orbital economy, to the scientists pursuing breakthrough discoveries and to dreamers across the world eager for a return to the Moon and the grand journey beyond--these are the most exciting times since the dawn of the space age-- and I truly believe the future we have all been waiting for will soon become reality.\n\nAnd to the best and brightest at NASA, and to all the commercial and international partners, we have an extraordinary responsibility--but the clock is running. The journey is never easy, but it is time to inspire the world once again to achieve the near-impossible--to undertake and accomplish big, bold endeavors in space...and when we do, we will make life better here at home and challenge the next generation to go even further.\n\nNASA will never be a caretaker of history--but will forever make history.\n\nGodspeed, President Donald J. Trump, and Godspeed NASA, as America leads the greatest adventure in human history 🇺🇸",
