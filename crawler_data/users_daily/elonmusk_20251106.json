Basically, being so compassionate it turns self-destructive. Sounds wild, but it’s real.\n\nGad Saad says we’re overloaded with emotion, treating every stranger like family, even criminals or enemies, because it feels good. \n\nBut feelings aren’t policies, and this kind of kindness is backfiring hard.\n\nTake U.S. borders: in 2023, a record 2.5 million illegal crossings swamped the system. \n\nIt’s not just overcrowding. Over 15,000 non-citizens were arrested for serious crimes in one year. \n\nFentanyl smuggling? Also up. And guess what? Those costs hit taxpayers: $150 billion a year, enough to help veterans or disaster victims. \n\nBut sure, let's keep pretending open borders are just \"nice.\"\n\nThen there's the “defund the police” mess. Meant to help communities, it led to fewer arrests and way more murders. A 70% jump in Minneapolis alone. \n\nThe people hurt most? The same communities it claimed to protect. \n\nBonus chaos: in the UK, people got arrested for tweets. That’s where feelings-over-facts leads.\n\nDEI programs? Started with good intentions. Now they’re breaking schools and jobs. \n\nA Forbes study said they mostly help rich elites, not everyday people. Harvard’s diversity policies even lowered team performance by 12%. \n\nIn companies, DEI training actually made bias worse. All because we’re scared to say, “Let’s hire the best person.”\n\nIt gets worse. All this empathy-for-everyone has made people stop trusting each other... down 20% since 2000. \n\nThis isn’t about being heartless. It’s about using your brain with your heart. \n\nIt's called “reasoned empathy,” where compassion meets common sense. \n\nHelp people, yes... but stop lighting your own house on fire to keep others warm.\n\nSource: @GadSaad, @elonmusk, Gonsalves, G, Kiskin K, Heritage, RAND, NYP, @Grok Imagine",
