For example, in the Master Plan Part II, you calculated it takes 6 billion of FSD miles driven before maybe the regulators would approve it. How did you know?”\n\nElon: “I generally try to get things to within an order of magnitude. So, it seemed to me like probably, and this was technically in kilometers, but it would be closer to 10 billion kilometers, which is roughly 6 billion miles than it would be to 1 billion. But I thought it would not take 100 billion kilometers. When you're trying to guess something where there's a lot of uncertainty, just try to get the estimate to the nearest order of magnitude, the closest factor of 10. And that's why I said, you know, probably around 10 billion kilometers or 6 billion miles.”\n\nTesla Shareholder Meeting, November 6, 2025",

        "text": "Why do I say that X is the best learning system the world has ever invented? \n\nThis is a very technical paper on how world models, er VLAs, make robots a lot smarter.\n\nClick the Grok button. And ask:\n\n“Hey Grok, can you explain why this is important like if I was a nine year old?”\n\nIts answer:\n\nImagine you're playing with a robot toy that can grab blocks or draw pictures, but it keeps dropping stuff because it doesn't know how to use its \"hands\" right. Bummer, right?\n\nNow, picture this super cool science trick called VITRA. \n\nIt's like giving the robot a magic TV that shows a million videos of real people doing fun, tricky things with their hands—like tying shoelaces, picking up a slippery banana, or building a Lego tower—without anyone telling them exactly what to do. \n\nThe robot watches super closely (from the person's own eyes' view!) and learns all the wiggly finger moves and what to say about them, like \"Hey, that's how you gently pick up the toy without squishing it!\"\n\nWhy is this awesome? Because now the robot gets really good at new tricks it hasn't seen before, just by watching a little more. \n\nIt can even try them out in the real world after practicing on a tiny bit of robot homework. \n\nSoon, robots could help with your chores (like folding laundry without messing it up) or play games with you way better. \n\nIt's like teaching a puppy new commands by showing videos instead of yelling—easier, faster, and way more fun! \n\nThis could make the world full of helpful robot buddies who learn like kids do. Cool, huh?\n\nThanks Grok!",
