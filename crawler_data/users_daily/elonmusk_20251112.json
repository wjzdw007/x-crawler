Power Report Shows EV Interest Surging in the U.S. Despite End of Federal Tax Credit.\n\nThe number of active car shoppers who say they are “very likely” to consider an EV rose to 24.2% in October—its highest level since January 2025. Overall, nearly 60% of potential buyers said they are at least “somewhat likely” to go electric in the next 12 months, a 2.6-point increase from September.\n\nAlso, in 2026, approximately 243,000 franchise EV leases are expected to expire—more than triple the number in 2025. Based on current patterns, 62% of those returning lessees are likely to replace their vehicles with another EV.",
