          "text": "I took delivery of a beautiful new shiny HW4 Tesla Model X today, so I immediately took it out for an FSD test drive, a bit like I used to do almost daily for 5 years. Basically... I'm amazed - it drives really, really well, smooth, confident, noticeably better than what I'm used to on HW3 (my previous car) and eons ahead of the version I remember driving up highway 280 on my first day at Tesla ~9 years ago, where I had to intervene every time the road mildly curved or sloped. (note this is v13, my car hasn't been offered the latest v14 yet)\n\nOn the highway, I felt like a passenger in some super high tech Maglev train pod - the car is locked in the center of the lane while I'm looking out from Model X's higher vantage point and its panoramic front window, listening to the (incredible) sound system, or chatting with Grok. On city streets, the car casually handled a number of tricky scenarios that I remember losing sleep over just a few years ago. It negotiated incoming cars in tight lanes, it gracefully went around construction and temporarily in-lane stationary cars, it correctly timed tricky left turns with incoming traffic from both sides, it gracefully gave way to the car that went out of order in the 4-way stop sign, it found a way to squeeze into a bumper to bumper traffic to make its turn, it overtook the bus that was loading passengers but still stopped for the stop sign that was blocked by the bus, and at the end of the route it circled around a parking lot, found a spot and... parked. Basically a flawless drive.\n\nFor context, I'm used to going out for a brief test drive around the neighborhood to return with 20 clips of things that could be improved. It's new for me to do just that and exactly like I used to, but come back with nothing. Perfect drive, no notes. I expect there's still more work for the team in the long march of 9s, but it's just so cool to see that we're beyond finding issues on any individual ~1 hour drive around the neighborhood, you actually have to go to the fleet and mine them. Back then, I processed the incredible promise of vehicle autonomy at scale (in the fully scaleable, vision only, end-to-end Tesla way) only intellectually, but now it is possible to feel it intuitively too if you just go out for a drive. Wait, of course surround video stream at 60Hz processed by a fully dedicated \"driving brain\" neural net will work, and it will be so much better and safer than a human driver. Did anyone else think otherwise?\n\nI also watched @aelluswamy 's new ICCV25 talk last week (https://t.co/RdaM23kvez) that hints at some of the recent under the hood technical components driving this progress. Sensor streams (videos, maps, kinematics, audio, ...) over long contexts (e.g. ~30 seconds) go into a big neural net, steering/acceleration comes out, optionally with visualization auxiliary data. This is the dream of the complete Software 1.0 -> Software 2.0 re-write that scales fully with data streaming from millions of cars in the fleet and the compute capacity of your chip, not some engineer's clever new DoubleParkedCarHandler C++ abstraction with undefined test-time characteristics of memory and runtime. There's a lot more hints in the video on where things are going with the emerging \"robotics+AI at scale stack\". World reconstructors, world simulators \"dreaming\" dynamics, RL, all of these components general, foundational, neural net based, how the car is really just one kind of robot... are people getting this yet?\n\nHuge congrats to the team - you're building magic objects of the future, you rock! And I love my car <3.",

I think it's very good encryption. We're testing it thoroughly. \n\nThere are no hooks in the X system for advertising. So if you look at something like WhatsApp or really any of the others, they've got hooks in there for advertising.

I'm amazed - it drives really, really well, smooth, confident, noticeably better than what I'm used to on HW3 (my previous car) and eons ahead of the version I remember driving up highway 280 on my first day at Tesla ~9 years ago, where I had to intervene every time the road mildly curved or sloped. (note this is v13, my car hasn't been offered the latest v14 yet)\n\nOn the highway, I felt like a passenger in some super high tech Maglev train pod - the car is locked in the center of the lane while I'm looking out from Model X's higher vantage point and its panoramic front window, listening to the (incredible) sound system, or chatting with Grok. On city streets, the car casually handled a number of tricky scenarios that I remember losing sleep over just a few years ago. It negotiated incoming cars in tight lanes, it gracefully went around construction and temporarily in-lane stationary cars, it correctly timed tricky left turns with incoming traffic from both sides, it gracefully gave way to the car that went out of order in the 4-way stop sign, it found a way to squeeze into a bumper to bumper traffic to make its turn, it overtook the bus that was loading passengers but still stopped for the stop sign that was blocked by the bus, and at the end of the route it circled around a parking lot, found a spot and... parked. Basically a flawless drive.”",

At second 5, the mage raises one hand, and the orbiting objects emit synchronized pulses of energy.\",\n    \"lighting\": \"Sunset magic hour light — orange and pink volumetric rays cut through the mist. Reflective metals catch golden highlights. The dragon glows faintly, casting ambient light through its wings.

Be specific AF: Instead of “Tell me about space,” say “Explain black holes like I’m 5, with a sci-fi twist.” Get tailored gold every time!\n2.  Chain your asks: Build on responses—follow up with “Expand on that” or “Code it in Python.” Context is king for deeper dives.\n3.  Unleash tools: Need real-time X buzz? Say “Search X for [topic].” Or crunch data? “Run code to plot [stats].” Grok’s got the toolkit!\nWhat’s your fave Grok hack?",

BUT when we generate long movies, we end up with lots of scenes... what grok needs for the same project of the movie, would be a First Frame -Last frame scene interpolation between the scenes (take last frame from scene one, and first frame from scene 2 and generate a mid scene that would merge scene 1 with scene 2 .. and continue for the other scenes (this could be very easy implemented with some python lines of code , like before spitting final video, select all scenes.. extract frames etc etc etc etc.. simple af, when u have all scenes + the interpolation scenes combine evrything with ffmpeg ).\n\n3.. list is long... and i dind't finished my coffee yet, so here is a grok TEXT to video short movie (coz lol u hit the limit for today).\n\nPrompts i used for each scene are a little more advanced, so i can see what grok is able to do ..\nthe prompts used are like this (can;t post all due to X limits ) :  { \"scene_1\": { \"global_cinematography\": \"Ultra-realistic Hollywood cyberpunk thriller in the vein of The Matrix (1999) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017), shot on Arri Alexa LF with anamorphic lenses for widescreen 2.39:1 aspect ratio, 24fps for fluid motion, desaturated palette dominated by cool blues, greens, and high-contrast neon reds piercing perpetual smog-choked night.

Simple, not cryptic.\n\nIt’s a quiet but major step toward X becoming a universal communications hub - part messenger, part phone, part file-share, part everything.\n\nWhat comes next? Maybe smoother cross-device syncing, more super-app features, and tighter integration as XChat becomes the backbone of the platform.\n\nAnd expect critics to complain while users quietly adopt it - because convenience always wins.\n\nX just made messaging feel modern again.\n\nSource: @X, @cb_doge, TechCrunch, Business Insider",

With audio, images, videos, and maybe even fewer weird donation banners.\n\nLaunched in 2025, Grokipedia started with over 885,000 articles and a mission: delete the drama. \n\nThis isn’t just about facts, not narratives. \n\nRenaming it Encyclopedia Galactica isn’t just a nerdy flex, it’s a mic drop. \n\nHe’s turning a search tool into a symbol, daring people to think bigger. \n\nIt's Elon’s way of saying: if humanity’s going down, at least we’ll go down informed.\n\nSource: @elonmusk",
