        "text": "One of the horrifying things I realized was Socialism was basically voting public’s begging to have serfdom again. This was something that was widely said during the early USSR, which was called “the second serfdom” by Russian peasants. In both there’s no private property, everything is collective and under total ownership by a repressive state. Russia was unusually bad as serfdom went, with High Medieval Western Europe being way better than either.\n\nWhat the Socialist says when they want no struggle, no property, no competition and no choice is “I crave a life of slavery that doesn’t require I think or take responsibility for my choices at all”. That’s why Communism always devolves into the state forcing you to work with terrible conditions, which is de facto identical to slavery. The fact they’re not mature  enough to realize they’re doing this should more than prove my point. \n\nThe feudal lord is way nicer by and large than the Socialist state. My historic speciality is the Middle Ages. You don’t want to fight me on this. The feudal lord gets to be rich and powerful while the Socialist state is impersonal. That’s the core of it. They would rather live in slavery than live better and know someone else is better than them",
