New Glenn still hasn’t launched. No reusable booster has ever landed. No Mars plan with dates.\n\nElon?\n•Falcon 9 boosters have landed 400+ times\n•Starship (bigger than anything ever built) is flying\n•Tesla sells 2 million cars a year and is worth more than the rest of the car industry combined\n•Solar + batteries are now the cheapest electricity source in history\n•First uncrewed Starships to Mars: 2026–2028. Crewed: late 2020s/early 2030s — exactly the timeline he gave in 2007\nThe vision never wavered. Not once.\n\nThe enthusiasm is the same calm, burning conviction you hear in that 2007 clip today.\n\nThe determination? He went personally bankrupt in 2008 keeping SpaceX and Tesla alive with his last dollars.\n\nAlmost 20 years later, every single “crazy” prediction from that interview is either already reality or on schedule.\n\nThis is what relentless execution looks like.\n\nWatch the 2007 interview (25 minutes that aged like fine wine):\n\nHe didn’t just dream about the future.\n\nHe scheduled it. And showed up.",
