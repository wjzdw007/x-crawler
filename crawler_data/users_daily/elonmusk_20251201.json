But it’s very hard.\n\nIf you care about the reality of goodness rather than simply the perception of it, it’s extremely difficult to give away money well.\n\nI have a large foundation, but I don’t put my name on it. In fact, I’ve said I don’t want my name on anything. The biggest challenge I find with the foundation is trying to give money away in a way that is truly beneficial to people.\n\nIt’s very easy to give money away in a way that creates the appearance of goodness. It is very difficult—extremely difficult—to give money away for the reality of goodness.”",
