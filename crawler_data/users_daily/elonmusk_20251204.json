I helped him build the computer that went into the the Model S AV system, his full self driving system. We were basically the FSD computer version 1, and so we were already working together.\n\nAnd when I announced DGX-1, nobody in the world wanted it. I had no purchase orders, not one. Nobody wanted to buy it. Nobody wanted to be part of it. Except for Elon. \n\nHe goes 'You know what, I have a company that could really use this.' I said, wow, my first customer. And he goes, it's an AI company, and it's a nonprofit and and we could really use one of these supercomputers. I boxed one up, I drove it up to San Francisco, and I delivered to the Elon in 2016.\"",
