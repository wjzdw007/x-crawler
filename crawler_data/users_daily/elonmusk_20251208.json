For example, after Nur’s death, a Somali diaspora website called Sahan Journal — a non-profit digital newsroom focused on minority communities in Minnesota — ran an obituary praising his long and \"esteemed\" military career in the Barre regime.\n\nYet major news outlets — including The New York Times and Reuters — still describe Nur as a \"teacher trainer\" while he was living in Somalia, relying on Snopes' and Politifact’s shallow, bad-faith fact-checks, which remain inaccurate.\n\nMeanwhile, another Barre regime officer, Yusuf Abdi Ali (\"Tukeh\"), was recently deported from the U.S. after courts found he committed human rights abuses while serving under Barre.\n\nTo be clear, Ilhan Omar isn’t responsible for her father’s decisions when she was a child. What does matter is how the fact-checking industry was able to kill a major political scandal with a thinly sourced, bad-faith \"fact check\" — protecting Democratic Party interests better than even the best crisis management firms could have ever dreamed.\n\nLink to the story is threaded. 👇",

Because their censorship becomes glaringly obvious\n\nAnd, you know, the best thing I found as a rebuttal, like if somebody, if there's a hoax, is just go to the source material. You know, if you think if somebody thinks, you know, it's, you know, Trump said that we should put Liz Cheney in a firing squad, I'm like, let me send you a link to X so you can watch his video. That's the best way. Don't take my opinion for it. Don't take anyone's opinion for it. Go to the source material and Community Notes\n\nYes, and Community Notes is awesome. It's incredible because everybody gets checked, including me. And with Community Notes, all the software is open source, and all the data is open source, so you can recreate any given note independently. That's amazing. Yeah. That's how it should be. Total absolute transparency in every way\n\nSometimes I get asked like, 'Elon, can you remove a note?' You know, mostly by the left, but sometimes by the right. I'm like, I don't even remove notes on my own account. Nothing. And, and by the way, everything is totally open. So if I did that, it would stick out like a sore thumb immediately. Like it's not going to be subtle\n\nThat is the best counter to misinformation. Yes, absolutely. Like let everybody look at it and say, 'Okay, here's what the actual facts say.' Yes, exactly. The counter to misinformation is better information\n\n Not just that, but having it checked in real-time by the community. So you have millions of people that can go over it and debate whether or not this is true or that's true. Yes, and, and like I said, the best way to understand the truth of things is don't take anyone's opinion for it. Look at the source material\n\nLook at what someone actually said, look at what someone actually did, look at the real videos of the situation, and then you'll actually know what's real",

No time for doomers; you’ve got Mars on speed dial.\n\n•You’re unapologetically pro-humanity: Rooting for innovation that lifts everyone—free speech, free thought, and free exploration.

Everything is allowed against white people. You can openly spread hatred and racism against white people. You can openly call for a violence against white people and nobody will ban you from social networks. Nobody will prosecute you or put you in jail for that. Nobody will prosecute you and trying to destroy your life because doing something like that.\n\nAnd that's why I consider it very important to repeat that for you as a white man, as a Christian father of the family, White Lives Matter”",

        "text": "Here's one idea about SpaceX's next big thing. AI computing (inference) on orbit, but how the hell can SpaceX do this cheaper than just building more datacenters on the ground?\n\nFrom first principles, it's an attractive proposition because the GPUs have extreme value per kg and extreme revenue per kW, both of which are relatively expensive. That is, the value prop somewhat washes out the pain of operating in space.\n\nSo I took a closer look. If anyone can make this work, it's a Starlink-derived system, so I started with the Starlink v3 satellites, with some high fidelity CEO-cad below. \n\nOrbital parameters. Pick a sun synchronous orbit - so we're in full 1400 kW/m^2 sunlight at all times. No need for batteries. Deploy the solar array in \"sun slicer\" mode, facing full sun, but the edge is pointing in the orbital direction (bottom right in these images) to minimize drag. But the inference Starlink (Star Thought?) satellites don't have to scrape the atmosphere. Being in SSO, they'll need to use the rest of the Starlink constellation for backhaul via laser links anyway, and higher orbits actually improve worst case latency (serving equatorial customers around midnight or noon) very slightly. Too high though, and SSO is relatively full of debris. Let's pick 560 km. \n\nA Starlink satellite in this orbit has full sun, so the back half is always shaded and relatively cool. The next hottest thing in the sky is the Earth, taking up almost half the sky to the bottom left in these images. So set up an MLI heat reflector there too, and then on the back side of the main bus we can use passive radiation to cool right down. The non-shiny parts of space are very cold. An array of this size produces about 130 kW of electrical power. \n\nIn this model, perhaps 200 H100-equivalent GPUs are racked on the main bus, generating 13,000 tokens per second, nowhere near enough to saturate a laser link. At $10/token, that's $4m of revenue per year. Assuming an all in cost of $50,000/kW (dominated by the GPUs on a kW or kg basis), that's something like 60% ROI per year. Obviously assumptions can vary.\n\nBut this neglects a broader point. \n\nStarlink satellites have to do all kinds of things that inference satellites don't have to, in particular, talk to millions of customers all over the world. If most of our power is just going to inference, would we change the design? \n\nEach solar array module produces about 6 kW. Each GPU consumes about 700 W. SpaceX could actually install GPUs directly to the solar module, matching optimal voltage and current levels and connecting each back to the main bus not with an insulated high voltage power cable, but a local wifi connection. There's then no real limit on how many modules can connect to each bus, which drives the overall power density of the system towards the thinnest solar arrays than can be flown, probably close to 1 kg/m^2 in the limit. \n\nThat is, the inference is performed by a thin piece of silicon that always faces the sun, connected to a somewhat smaller piece of thin silicon with billions of logic gates in it. This helps the thermal problem too, because we're not bringing a bunch of power into one concentrated place. \n\nIf one Starship can launch 100 T to LEO, then that gets close to 30 MW of inference per launch. 1000 launches is 30 GW. Now we're talking real scale - and provided the revenue per kWh is greater than about $4.00, I think the economics work out.\n\nI've seen a bunch of high inclination Starlink launches from Vandenberg recently, but I don't think any of them were going to SSO. \n\nIn any case, a ring of inference satellites visible at dawn and dusk running north south will be awesome.",

Fast, clean, and no air conditioning required.\n\nOne megaton of these space-sats per year = 100 gigawatts of new AI power, every year. That’s like building dozens of nuclear plants, but without the nuclear part, or the Earth part.\n\nNext step? Build factories on the Moon and use giant railguns (yes, seriously) to launch satellites into space without rockets.\n\nAll of this, apparently, is how we start becoming a \"Kardashev Type II civilization\", which basically means “humans who’ve stopped thinking small.”\n\nGoodbye server farms.
