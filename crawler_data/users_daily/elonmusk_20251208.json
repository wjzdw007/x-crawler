For example, after Nur’s death, a Somali diaspora website called Sahan Journal — a non-profit digital newsroom focused on minority communities in Minnesota — ran an obituary praising his long and \"esteemed\" military career in the Barre regime.\n\nYet major news outlets — including The New York Times and Reuters — still describe Nur as a \"teacher trainer\" while he was living in Somalia, relying on Snopes' and Politifact’s shallow, bad-faith fact-checks, which remain inaccurate.\n\nMeanwhile, another Barre regime officer, Yusuf Abdi Ali (\"Tukeh\"), was recently deported from the U.S. after courts found he committed human rights abuses while serving under Barre.\n\nTo be clear, Ilhan Omar isn’t responsible for her father’s decisions when she was a child. What does matter is how the fact-checking industry was able to kill a major political scandal with a thinly sourced, bad-faith \"fact check\" — protecting Democratic Party interests better than even the best crisis management firms could have ever dreamed.\n\nLink to the story is threaded. 👇",

Because their censorship becomes glaringly obvious\n\nAnd, you know, the best thing I found as a rebuttal, like if somebody, if there's a hoax, is just go to the source material. You know, if you think if somebody thinks, you know, it's, you know, Trump said that we should put Liz Cheney in a firing squad, I'm like, let me send you a link to X so you can watch his video. That's the best way. Don't take my opinion for it. Don't take anyone's opinion for it. Go to the source material and Community Notes\n\nYes, and Community Notes is awesome. It's incredible because everybody gets checked, including me. And with Community Notes, all the software is open source, and all the data is open source, so you can recreate any given note independently. That's amazing. Yeah. That's how it should be. Total absolute transparency in every way\n\nSometimes I get asked like, 'Elon, can you remove a note?' You know, mostly by the left, but sometimes by the right. I'm like, I don't even remove notes on my own account. Nothing. And, and by the way, everything is totally open. So if I did that, it would stick out like a sore thumb immediately. Like it's not going to be subtle\n\nThat is the best counter to misinformation. Yes, absolutely. Like let everybody look at it and say, 'Okay, here's what the actual facts say.' Yes, exactly. The counter to misinformation is better information\n\n Not just that, but having it checked in real-time by the community. So you have millions of people that can go over it and debate whether or not this is true or that's true. Yes, and, and like I said, the best way to understand the truth of things is don't take anyone's opinion for it. Look at the source material\n\nLook at what someone actually said, look at what someone actually did, look at the real videos of the situation, and then you'll actually know what's real",
