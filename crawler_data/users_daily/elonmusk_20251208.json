For example, after Nur’s death, a Somali diaspora website called Sahan Journal — a non-profit digital newsroom focused on minority communities in Minnesota — ran an obituary praising his long and \"esteemed\" military career in the Barre regime.\n\nYet major news outlets — including The New York Times and Reuters — still describe Nur as a \"teacher trainer\" while he was living in Somalia, relying on Snopes' and Politifact’s shallow, bad-faith fact-checks, which remain inaccurate.\n\nMeanwhile, another Barre regime officer, Yusuf Abdi Ali (\"Tukeh\"), was recently deported from the U.S. after courts found he committed human rights abuses while serving under Barre.\n\nTo be clear, Ilhan Omar isn’t responsible for her father’s decisions when she was a child. What does matter is how the fact-checking industry was able to kill a major political scandal with a thinly sourced, bad-faith \"fact check\" — protecting Democratic Party interests better than even the best crisis management firms could have ever dreamed.\n\nLink to the story is threaded. 👇",
