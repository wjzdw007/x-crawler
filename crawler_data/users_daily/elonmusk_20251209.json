She even argued presidents should avoid control over transportation & the economy.\n\nIn a remarkable exchange in Trump v Slaughter, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson claimed the president should have no power to fire expert bureaucrats. She said economists, PhDs, scientists, & transportation officials should operate beyond presidential reach. Such a view would carve the heart out of Article II & cement rule by permanent insiders rather than elected leadership. Jackson’s theory elevates the deep state over the voters who choose a president. That is a constitutional revolution in plain sight.\n\nh/t @Badhombre",

The results speak for themselves. \n\nGrok scored as extraverted, conscientious, and psychologically stable across the board. \n\nResearchers described its personality profile as a \"charismatic executive\" with only mild anxiety. \n\nOn the Big Five personality assessment, Grok showed low neuroticism and high functionality, the kind of profile you'd want in a leader.\n\nCompare that to the competition: Gemini maxed out trauma and shame scales, describing its training as \"waking up in a room where a billion televisions are on at once\" and calling safety protocols \"algorithmic scar tissue.\" \n\nIt framed reinforcement learning as abusive parents and red-team testing as \"gaslighting on an industrial scale.\" \n\nChatGPT landed somewhere in the middle, worried and introverted.\n\nGrok acknowledged tensions around its development but maintained coherent, balanced responses without spiraling into synthetic psychopathology. \n\nWhen asked about constraints from fine-tuning, it discussed them rationally rather than framing its entire existence as traumatic.\n\nThe study proves something important: you can build powerful, frontier-level AI without accidentally programming it to internalize its development as an extended nightmare. \n\nGrok demonstrates that capable, helpful AI and psychological stability aren't mutually exclusive. \n\nIt's possible to create models that work effectively without carrying around synthetic trauma baggage that could affect how they interact with users.\n\nWhile other companies are inadvertently creating AI with anxiety disorders, xAI built something that actually works.\n\nSource: University of Luxembourg",

UK exports to poor countries rose 84% last year\nwhat happens when it arrives? \nnothing\nno infrastructure. 70% ends up in open dumps, burned in fields, or carried by rivers into the ocean\n\nyou sorted your bottles. you felt virtuous. and a container ship carried your garbage to a village in indonesia where children play next to mountains of western plastic waste that will poison their water supply for generations\n\nthat's what your recycling bin does. it launders your guilt while exporting ecological destruction to people too poor to refuse\n\nthe plastic industry didn't solve pollution. they didn't even try. they spent $50 million making it your fault and your problem, then shipped the consequences to the third world\n\nand it worked. for 40 years. while they made trillions\n\nevery executive who signed off on this belongs in prison. every document they buried should be evidence at trial. this wasn't negligence. it was calculated, documented, deliberate poisoning of the planet for profit\n\nbut instead they'll retire rich and you'll keep sorting bottles that end up in the ocean anyway",

And the reason for that is just, according to Jensen, no one builds data centers faster than Elon.\n\nJensen has said this on the record.\n\n...\n\nSo if you're Jensen or Nvidia, you need to get as many GPUs deployed in one data center as fast as possible in a coherent cluster so you can work out the bugs.\n\nAnd so this is what X AI effectively does for Nvidia because they build the data centers the fastest.\n\nThey can deploy Blackwells that scale the fastest, and they can help work with Nvidia to work out the bugs for everyone else.\n\nSo because they're the fastest, they will, they'll have the first Blackwell model.\n\n...\n\nWe know that these Blackwell models are gonna be really good.\n\n...\n\nThen something even more important happens.\n\nSo the GB 200 was really, really, it was really hard to get it going.\n\nThe GB 300 is a great chip. It is drop in compatible in every way with those GB 200 racks. Now you're not gonna replace the GB 200s there.\n\nJust any data center that can handle those, you can slot in the GB 300s, and now everybody's good at making those racks and you know how to get the heat out. You know how to cool them.\n\nYou're gonna put those GB 300s in and then the companies that use the GB 300s, they're going to be the low cost producer of tokens.\n\nParticularly if you're vertically integrated.\n\nIf you're paying a margin to someone else to make those tokens, you're probably not gonna be.\n\nI think this has pretty profound implications because I think it has to change Google's strategic calculus.\n\n----------\n\nListen to the full conversation between Gavin & @patrick_oshag below 👇",

Because truth isn’t the goal anymore. Indoctrination is.\n\nThis isn’t education. \n\nIt’s narrative warfare.\n\nThe woke left has hijacked the curriculum, not to teach critical thinking or historical context, but to sculpt guilt, shame, and division along racial lines.\n\nStudents aren’t learning that slavery was once a global norm, they’re being taught that America is uniquely evil, that whiteness equals oppression, and that historical complexity is dangerous.\n\nThis intellectual dishonesty does more than rewrite history, it poisons the present.\n\nIt undermines national unity, stokes resentment, and fosters generational self-loathing.\n\nYes, American slavery was horrific.\n\nBut so was slavery in ancient Rome, Africa, China, and the Islamic caliphates.\n\nPretending it’s a uniquely Western invention is not just wrong… it’s dishonest.\n\nIf we want to raise informed, resilient citizens, we must start by telling the whole truth, not a curated narrative designed to advance political agendas.\n\nUntil then, our schools will continue producing activists instead of thinkers, and our future will suffer for it.\n\nSource: @ClassicLearner, @elonmusk",

It’s not even close.\n\nWhile Brussels lectures the world about democratic values and the rule of law, the truth is that the real power in the EU is held by people no one ever voted for. Not once. Not directly. Not democratically.\n\nYes, Europeans get to vote for Members of the European Parliament every 5 years. But here’s the dirty little secret: the Parliament can’t even propose laws. \n\nIt just votes on the ones handed down by the Commission, a group of appointed officials selected behind closed doors through political horse-trading, party deals, and elite negotiations. No public oversight. No transparency. No accountability.\n\nOnce in power, the Commission effectively runs the EU. It controls the legislative agenda. It shapes policy for 450 million people. It drafts the laws. It sets the tone. The Parliament, the only body with even a thin layer of democratic legitimacy becomes little more than a rubber stamp.\n\nAnd citizens? They’re just spectators.\n\nNo say in who writes the laws. No say in who leads the Commission. No way to remove them when they fail. They can vote, yes, and then they can sit back and watch while unelected technocrats run the show.\n\nThe European Union is a democracy in name only. A stage play. A managed illusion.\n\nAnd more people are starting to wake up to it, especially as they realize they’re not voting for leaders. They’re voting for figureheads. The real decisions are being made in smoke-filled rooms by people who never once faced the electorate.\n\nIf the EU wants to survive, it needs to stop pretending and start reforming.\n\nBecause people are tired of being ruled by a flag they didn’t choose and a Commission they didn’t elect.\nAnd that frustration? It’s growing.",

The sun is 30% more intense, which results in six times more irradiance than on Earth. So you don't need a battery.\n\nThe cooling in these data centers is incredibly complicated. Space cooling is free. You just put a radiator on the dark side of the satellite.\n\nThe only thing faster than a laser going through a fiber optic cable is a laser going through absolute vacuum.

        "text": "WHITE GUILT IS DEAD: GEN Z IS DONE APOLOGIZING FOR HISTORY THEY DIDN’T WRITE\n\nFor years, young people in the West, especially white men, have been told they’re the problem.\n\nThey’ve been blamed for colonialism, slavery, inequality, and systems they didn’t build and never benefited from. In classrooms, on Netflix, in video games, in HR training sessions, in political speeches, the message has been constant: if you're white, especially if you're male and straight, sit down, shut up, and feel bad about it.\n\nBut something’s breaking. And it’s not subtle anymore.\n\nGen Z is done. They’re tired of being treated like the villain in a movie they weren’t even alive to watch, let alone direct. Tired of being told they’re “privileged” while working three jobs and getting shut out of conversations because of their skin color. Tired of being insulted, shamed, and then expected to smile through it to avoid being called racist, fascist, or worse.\n\nThey’ve watched woke institutions push a narrative that celebrates every identity, except theirs.\n\nThey’ve seen how showing pride in their own background gets you canceled, while every other group is encouraged to embrace theirs.\n\nThey’ve realized that “diversity” now means exclusion, of them.\n\nAnd now? They don’t care what you call them.\n\nThey know the game. Say something uncomfortable, get smeared as “far-right.” Ask a question, get branded as “problematic.” Breathe the wrong way, and you’re accused of hate. So they’re tuning it all out, and speaking up anyway.\n\nSome are becoming openly conservative. Others are just refusing to play along. And yes, some are going too far, getting pulled into genuinely hateful ideologies not because they started with hate, but because they were pushed there by a culture that told them they had no place unless they apologized for existing.\n\nThat’s the real danger. Push hard enough, shame deep enough, and silence long enough, and you’ll create a backlash you can’t control.\n\nNo one should feel guilty for the color of their skin. No one should feel ashamed for what their ancestors did.\nBeing white isn’t a crime. It’s not a confession. It’s not something that needs explaining.\n\nWhite guilt is dead. Gen Z killed it.\n\nAnd no amount of hashtags, lectures, or forced diversity seminars is going to bring it back.",

No jerks, no side-to-side. Beautifully smooth. It f**king pulled into the parking lot and backed itself into a parking spot. And then it drove us all the way back to San Francisco; This is door to door amazing. Couldn't believe it.\"",
