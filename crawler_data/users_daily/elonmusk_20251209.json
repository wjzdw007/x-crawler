She even argued presidents should avoid control over transportation & the economy.\n\nIn a remarkable exchange in Trump v Slaughter, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson claimed the president should have no power to fire expert bureaucrats. She said economists, PhDs, scientists, & transportation officials should operate beyond presidential reach. Such a view would carve the heart out of Article II & cement rule by permanent insiders rather than elected leadership. Jackson’s theory elevates the deep state over the voters who choose a president. That is a constitutional revolution in plain sight.\n\nh/t @Badhombre",
