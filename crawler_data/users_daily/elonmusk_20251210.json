This is the first design where success is in the set of possible outcomes. There were a lot of performance improvements for v3 so it made sense to go to v3, there's like 10,000 different changes between v2 and v3. \n\nThere just aren't very many things that are in the top 10 of the evolution of life.

A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nAsimov's Three Laws of Robotics were meant to ensure robots prioritize human safety, obedience, and self-preservation. However, his stories largely revolved around how these laws failed in practice, leading to paradoxes, loopholes, and unintended consequences in complex scenarios.\n\nApplying these laws to AGI seems even more flawed, as AGI would possess human-level or superior adaptability, potentially rewriting or evading any imposed constraints. Since AGI is defined by its uncontrollability, fostering intrinsic honesty—where the system voluntarily aligns with human values and discloses its reasoning—offers a more realistic path to coexistence, avoiding the pitfalls Asimov illustrated. \n\n@Grok feels like the best avenue for humanity to benefit from AGI.",

It's like, am I just emerging from prison, perhaps, with a stipend? All my companies have been confiscated.\"\n\n\"I mean, it would take armageddon, which hopefully that doesn't happen, like Ragnarok next level, and I lost.\"\n\n\"I mean, it's impossible for someone to have this amount of knowledge, all the knowledge that I have, and then be dropped down to a low resource amount.\"\n\n\"Because the reality is that either something truly catastrophic has happened, like civilization has melted, or I will be able to ask people to just give me money, and with the promise that I will have a high return, which is what I'm able to do right now.

        "text": "In January 2015, Google and Fidelity wrote a combined $1 billion check for roughly 10% of SpaceX. The company was valued at $12 billion. Google’s portion: approximately $900 million for 7.4%.\n\nAt the time, SpaceX had just successfully landed a Falcon 9 first stage for the first time. Starlink was a PowerPoint presentation. Revenue was a rounding error compared to today.\n\nTen years later, SpaceX has become the most valuable private company on Earth.\n\nThe valuation trajectory tells the story:\n\n2015: $12 billion\n2020: $36 billion\n2021: $100 billion\n2022: $127 billion\n2023: $180 billion\nJune 2024: $210 billion\nLate 2024: $350 billion\n2026 IPO target: $1.5 trillion\n\nThat $900 million investment from Google? At the $1.5 trillion IPO target, it would be worth approximately $111 billion.\n\nA 123x return. From one check.\n\nTo put that in perspective: Adobe’s entire market cap is $144 billion. Google’s single 2015 investment in SpaceX would be worth more than 75% of one of the largest software companies on the planet.\n\nBut here’s where it gets interesting.\n\nIn Q1 2025, Alphabet reported $8 billion in unrealized gains from a “non-marketable equity security in a private company.” Bloomberg confirmed it was SpaceX. That $8 billion boost represented nearly 25% of Google’s entire net income for the quarter.\n\nOne investment. One quarter. Almost a quarter of their earnings.\n\nAnd that was based on the $350 billion valuation from late 2024. If SpaceX hits the $1.5 trillion target, the paper gains from this single position could exceed $80 billion more.\n\nThe financial return alone would justify calling this one of the greatest venture investments ever made. But the financial return is actually the boring part.\n\nLook at what SpaceX has become.\n\nStarlink went from zero subscribers in 2020 to 1 million in 2022 to 4.6 million by end of 2024 to 8 million by November 2025. They’re doubling annually. Revenue hit $7.7 billion in 2024, up from $1.4 billion in 2022. Projections for 2025: $11.8 billion. Starlink now represents 58% of SpaceX’s total revenue and the majority of its profits.\n\nSpaceX has reused a single Falcon 9 booster more than 20 times. They completed 134 Falcon-family launches in 2024. They’re on pace for 150+ in 2025. They now account for approximately 90% of the world’s payload mass delivered to orbit.\n\nRead that again. One company. Ninety percent of global payload mass.\n\nThe reusability breakthrough is what made Starlink possible. You can’t launch 7,500+ satellites on expendable rockets. The math doesn’t work. But when you can reuse boosters 20 times and turn launches around in under 30 days, you can build an orbital internet constellation that would have been economically impossible for any other company on Earth.\n\nAnd then there’s the government money.\n\nSpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell said the company holds $22 billion in government contracts. Pentagon contracts alone total nearly $8 billion. The Space Force just awarded SpaceX $5.92 billion for satellite launches through 2029. The National Reconnaissance Office signed a classified $1.8 billion contract for Starshield, SpaceX’s militarized satellite network for intelligence and surveillance. The Pentagon plans to acquire more than 100 Starshield satellites for its future satcom architecture.\n\nSpaceX is now the dominant launch provider for the U.S. military, the U.S. intelligence community, and NASA. They have more government contracts than most defense contractors, but they’re valued like a tech company because they actually are one.\n\nStarlink isn’t just consumer internet anymore. It’s 75,000 vessels with maritime connectivity. 300 cruise ships. United, Air France, Hawaiian Airlines. Direct-to-cell service launching with T-Mobile. Military encrypted communications via Starshield. Ukraine’s battlefield connectivity runs on Starlink.\n\nThis used to be a rocket company. Now it’s a telecom company that happens to own the rockets.",

It's straining grids, drying up water supplies, and forcing hyperscalers into massive infrastructure deals.\n\nSpace solves all these constraints:\n• Unlimited solar energy, as there is no atmosphere blocking the sun\n• Natural cooling; the space is literally an infinite freezer\n• No land, no grid, no water limitations\n\nGoogle is now preparing to launch the first test satellites for Project Suncatcher in 2027 to explore space-based computing.\n\nIn hindsight, Google's investment in SpaceX was both a financial and strategic win.",

The ongoing injustice to the family is grossly understated.\n\nExantus didn't only slaughter White 6-year-old Logan Tipton, stabbing Logan to death in Logan's own bedroom, he also attempted to murder three of Logan's siblings and Logan's father - stabbing a total of 5 family members.\n\nHere's exactly how that horrific December night unfolded at the Tipton's home in Kentucky:\n\n~ Ronald Exantus enters the Tipton home around 4AM, carrying a large kitchen knife\n\n~ Exantus enters the bedroom of 6-year-old Logan and his 4-year-old brother\n\n~ Exantus pulls Logan off of the top bunk bed and quite literally slaughters him, stabbing him in the head and neck dozens upon dozens of times, violently killing him in the bloodiest possible fashion\n\n~ Exantus then stabs Logan's 4-year-old brother in the head multiple times (but the boy survives)\n\n~ Exantus then enters the bedroom where Logan's 8 and 11-year-old sisters are sleeping\n\n~ Exantus stabs the 11-year-old girl multiple times in the head and torso and throws her across the room (she survives)\n\n~ Exantus stabs the 8-year-old girl multiple times in the head and neck (she survives)\n\n~ The commotion awakens Logan's 13-year-old sister, who comes upon the nightmarish scene and screams\n\n~ The girl's scream wake Logan's father, who comes to his family's aid, fights Exantus unarmed, is stabbed multiple times, but successfully forces Exantus out of the home\n\nWhen the case goes to trial, Exantus is found NOT GUILTY by reason of insanity for the savage murder of 6-year-old Logan Tipton. He's found \"guilty but mentally ill\" for the following:\n\n~ Criminal Attempt To Commit Murder (for stabbing the three other children)\n\n~ First Degree Assault (for stabbing the three other children)\n\n~ First Degree Burglary (first degree because of inflicted injuries)\n\nRonald Exantus was sentenced to 20 years in the Kentucky Department of Corrections.\n\nNot one single day of that sentence was for what he did to 6-year-old Logan Tipton. He will never suffer any legal consequences specifically for what he did to Logan.\n\nFast-forward to October 1 of this year, and Ronald Exantus was released early for \"good behavior\" after serving less than half of his sentence.\n\nHe immediately relocated to Florida, was arrested a week later for failing to register as a convicted felon, and has been returned to prison in Kentucky for this parole violation.\n\nAnd, after all of this, guess what?\n\nHe's scheduled to be fully released in June of 2026. No parole. No nothing. A 100% free man.\n\nIn six months, this literal monster will be just as free as you or me - more free than every surviving member of Logan's family, who've lived in a mental prison ever since, and now must live in a world where the criminal psychopath who tried to kill them all is being set loose back upon society without restriction.\n\nA murdered 6-year-old.\nAttempted murder of a 4, 8, and 11-year-old.\nAttempted murder of their father.\nA bloodbath crime scene for the ages.\nAnd the man who did it walks free 10 years later.\n\nI lack the vocabulary to convey how evil this system is.",
