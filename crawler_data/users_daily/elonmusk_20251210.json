This is the first design where success is in the set of possible outcomes. There were a lot of performance improvements for v3 so it made sense to go to v3, there's like 10,000 different changes between v2 and v3. \n\nThere just aren't very many things that are in the top 10 of the evolution of life.

A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nAsimov's Three Laws of Robotics were meant to ensure robots prioritize human safety, obedience, and self-preservation. However, his stories largely revolved around how these laws failed in practice, leading to paradoxes, loopholes, and unintended consequences in complex scenarios.\n\nApplying these laws to AGI seems even more flawed, as AGI would possess human-level or superior adaptability, potentially rewriting or evading any imposed constraints. Since AGI is defined by its uncontrollability, fostering intrinsic honesty—where the system voluntarily aligns with human values and discloses its reasoning—offers a more realistic path to coexistence, avoiding the pitfalls Asimov illustrated. \n\n@Grok feels like the best avenue for humanity to benefit from AGI.",

Elon Musk gives the most ELON answer to \"what would you do if you started over with $1,000?\"\n\n\"It's somewhat of an impossible dichotomy, because civilization would have had to have been destroyed or something, in which case $1,000 is not going to solve your problems.\"\n\n\"And if civilization hasn't melted, then I could probably just tell people to give me money, which I've done before.\" 🤣🔥 @elonmusk \n\n\"A lot of things would have to go wrong for that to be the case. It's like, am I just emerging from prison, perhaps, with a stipend? All my companies have been confiscated.\"\n\n\"I mean, it would take armageddon, which hopefully that doesn't happen, like Ragnarok next level, and I lost.\"\n\n\"I mean, it's impossible for someone to have this amount of knowledge, all the knowledge that I have, and then be dropped down to a low resource amount.\"\n\n\"Because the reality is that either something truly catastrophic has happened, like civilization has melted, or I will be able to ask people to just give me money, and with the promise that I will have a high return, which is what I'm able to do right now. Like if you give me a dollar, you will get back much more than a dollar.\"",
