The degree to which a Starship is a revolutionary technology is not well understood in the world.\n\nIt's the first time that there's been any rocket design where full and rapid reusability is possible. This is the first design where success is in the set of possible outcomes. There were a lot of performance improvements for v3 so it made sense to go to v3, there's like 10,000 different changes between v2 and v3. \n\nThere just aren't very many things that are in the top 10 of the evolution of life. So if there were to be a catastrophe on one of the planets, the other planet would survive and no AI was used to create it.\"",
