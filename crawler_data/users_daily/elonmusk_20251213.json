So much cool engineering visible here: https://t.co/M0gYV0m2oR\n\nThe first Starlink sats were black to avoid being visible at dawn and dusk (when the sun still illuminates them at high altitude, but people on the ground are in the dark). But black absorption heats up the satellites and is ~ 96% effective at absorbing light. What’s better? A near perfect mirror that reflects sunlight away from the satellite and from Earth, making the flat phased array antenna panels that always face Earth nearly invisible (reflecting over 99.9% of light). The core of the film is a Bragg mirror, a dielectric mirror film which includes many super thin layers of plastic with different refractive indices that create interference patterns internally to reflect light, but allow radio waves to pass through unimpeded.\n\nPhased array antennae are themselves amazing, a 2D grid of transceivers that collectively steer microwave beams to the Starlink terminals below, with no moving parts.\n\nYou can also see one of my favorite engineering innovations SpaceX, developed with an integrated perspective on satellite and rocket design. At the end of the video, you see the upper stage of the Falcon 9 rocket spinning away. Prior to release of the stack of satellites, the entire upper stage goes into a slow spin.  Then it pops a couple retention latches, and the stack of 27 satellites splay out like a deck of cards, each with a slightly different angular momentum given the distances from the centroid of spin. This tiny difference in velocity for each satellite gives them a greater separation over time as they orbit Earth.  No springs needed; the whole system sets up the deployment dynamics in an elegant, minimalist manner. And this early phase is when they look like a string of pearls, still close together, and visible at dawn or dusk before they get the highly reflective surfaces rotated into proper position.\n\nAt the top and bottom at 13 seconds in, you can see the two retention bars that hold the stack of sats in place during launch. That’s very little wasted weight versus a typical ESPA bus holding a bunch of satellites on a central metal cylinder as you see in Transporter missions.",

But if such voices existed, they were ignored. And the activists pressed on until they succeeded in nothing less than reshaping reality itself.\n\nAnd they didn’t just persuade people to politely look the other way.\n\nThey rallied good, decent people to march in the streets demanding that teenagers sacrifice their health, their fertility, and their sexual function in the name of this belief.\n\nThey convinced governments to write laws based on a non-existent, fictional concept.\n\nThey enlisted well-meaning teachers to poison the minds of a generation with absurd lies.\n\nAnd they drove doctors to amputate healthy organs and call it medicine.\n\nIf they could succeed in creating that false reality, then surely we can succeed in restoring truth. \n\nBecause our cause is not built on lies but on logic and reason. Not on ideology but on sound ethical principles. Not on harm but on healing.\n\nMy talk at @genspect’s conference in Albuquerque calls for the complete rejection of this dangerous belief. \n\nOnly by restoring truth and reality can we actually protect vulnerable people from this medical crime.",
