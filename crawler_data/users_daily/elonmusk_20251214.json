It's time to wake up.\n\nSource: @cb_doge, @elonmusk",

It assumes they are and refuses to give them power over others.\n\nThat’s the point.\n\nGreed under capitalism is constrained by consent. You only get richer by offering something others voluntarily choose to pay for. If you stop providing value, the money stops.\n\nGreed under collectivism is unconstrained. It’s backed by force. You get resources whether you create value or not, so long as you can moralize need or capture political power.\n\nAlso, capitalism doesn’t pit competition against cooperation. Competition is how we discover who can cooperate best. Every successful business is a massive act of cooperation with customers, workers, suppliers, and investors. It just isn’t coerced cooperation.\n\nAnd the claim that capitalists never give back is empirically false. Private charity, philanthropy, reinvestment, and voluntary aid explode under capitalist systems and collapse under socialist ones.\n\nWhat you’re really saying is this:\n\nYou don’t trust individuals to choose generosity. You trust the state to enforce it.\n\nThat isn’t moral. It’s just replacing voluntary cooperation with compulsory obedience.",

Her vivid blue hair flows dynamically, suggesting movement frozen in time. Styled strictly in 80s Anime Style, characterized by cel-shaded color blocks, crisp outlines, and high contrast shading. Her intricate glossy black and neon red power armor features pronounced, exaggerated shoulder pads characteristic of the era. Rendered in 4K sharpness. A tight cinematic close-up focused primarily on her face and the glowing katana blade, with her eyes featuring large glossy reflections to evoke feeling. The scene uses dramatic low-key volumetric lighting, featuring intense purple-blue illumination and neon-glow signs reflecting intensely off the wet pavement and the metal armor.\n\nvideo prompt:\n\nGrok Imagine Video Prompt: Supersonic Panning Combat\n\nDuration: 6 seconds (Fixed Clip Length)\n\nPOSITIVE PROMPT\n\nSubject and Fidelity: The virtuosic, fiercely determined female cybernetic anime warrior from the source image, maintaining face fidelity and high consistency in expressions and anatomical proportions. The character adheres strictly to 80s Anime Style, featuring cel-shaded color blocks and crisp outlines. The visuals must render in hyper-detailed 4K sharpness.\n\nAction and Motion (Non-Stop Sequential Combat): The warrior launches instantly and continues moving forward, dashing at impossible kinetic speed (Flash speed), generating a brilliant, trailing blue-white energy corona. In a controlled, seamless motion, she executes a diving aerial dodge that transitions into a fluid, ground-hugging combat roll. While moving, she executes three consecutive, hyper-fast vertical energy katana slashes aimed off-screen. The action must convey non-stop forward momentum across the entire 6-second duration, emphasizing hyper-detailed motion blur effects from extreme velocity.\n\nCamera Movement and Framing (Complex Dynamic Pan/Orbit): Initiate with a dynamic low-angle tracking shot following the supersonic movement at ground level. Transition into a fast, continuous 360-degree slow orbit (rotational pan) around the warrior, synchronized with the mid-air dive and ground roll, to dynamically reveal the entire 3D scene. Execute a synchronized fast whip pan motion precisely timed to the final katana slashes. The framing should use an 85mm portrait lens style with extreme shallow depth of field (bokeh) to isolate the moving warrior against the background.\n\nVisual Style and Lighting: Dramatic cinematic volumetric low-key lighting is mandatory. Use intense purple-blue illumination and neon red reflections glistening vividly off the metallic armor and the wet, nighttime cyberpunk background. High-contrast shading is required.\n\nAudio Direction (Native Synthesis): Native audio-video synchronization required.\n\nThe sound must feature a distinct, deep supersonic boom precisely timed to the initial dash, a sustained crackling energy hum corresponding to the kinetic corona, and three separate, sharp schhwing metallic sound effects synchronized exactly with each katana slash. The background score must be an upbeat, intense orchestral-electronic synthwave track",

Imagine them having operations to darken their skin and mimic stereotypically black features.   Imagine them walking around in blackface, and saying it’s the exact same thing as actually being black. \n\nImagine them being honored as black citizens by the White House, being summoned to talk to the President about issues facing the black community, being supported by celebrities, and having laws passed to make white people who identify as black a protected class.   \n\nImagine these people demanding membership in black organizations, insisting that they receive a share of the reparations that CA is about to pay, and demanding they be given awards created specifically to honor black achievement. Then imagine them getting their way.  \n\nNow imagine mobs of them showing up to black events that don’t include them, carrying threatening signs and air horns to drown out any speakers with noise. Imagine them coming up with slurs for any black person who doesn’t accept that white people are black if they say they are.   \n\nImagine them calling for the rape, torture, and mass murder of any black person who disagrees with them. Imagine them getting black people doxxed, harassed, assaulted, fired from their jobs, and investigated by the police for saying that you have to be born black to be black.   \n\nNow imagine the government supporting their demands.  \n\nThat’s exactly the position that women are in right now, with a few extras, like being locked in cells with dangerous men, the sexual predation of lesbians via coercion, and the increased risk of sexual assault in what used to be female-only spaces. Our oppressors are now claiming not only the right to oppress us in whole new ways, but the right to erase our identities as women and rewrite the meaning of womanhood in ways that suit - and include - them.  \n\nIf you wouldn’t support this kind of behavior towards black people, you have no business supporting this kind of behavior towards women.",
