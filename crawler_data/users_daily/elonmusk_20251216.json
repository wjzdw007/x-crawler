Here are a few things you need to know\n\n> Mars formed about 4.5 billion years ago alongside Earth and likely started as a warmer, wetter world before it lost its global magnetic field and dried into the cold desert seen today\n\n> Mars is only about half the physical size of Earth, but because it has no oceans, its total dry land area is similar to all of Earth’s continents combined, making it effectively 100% usable “real estate”\n\n> Surface gravity on Mars is just 38% of Earth’s, so you could jump roughly three times higher and lift much heavier objects than you could on Earth\n\n> New evidence suggests a massive reservoir of liquid water may be trapped 10–20 kilometers beneath the Martian crust, theoretically enough to cover the whole planet in an ocean if it were brought to the surface\n\n> The search for alien life has intensified after NASA’s Perseverance rover found rocks with “leopard spot” patterns that may record chemical signatures consistent with ancient microbial life, though the findings are still being tested\n\n> Martian weather is extreme: the average temperature is about -81°F (-62°C) and can drop near -225°F in some regions, yet summer days near the equator can briefly reach around 70°F, similar to a mild day on Earth\n\n> Colonizing Mars will be difficult because of toxic soil, high radiation, and a very thin atmosphere, but deep underground water and protected subterranean habitats could make long-term human survival scientifically possible\n\n> Sunsets on Mars appear blue rather than red because fine dust in the thin atmosphere scatters red light away from the line of sight and lets more blue light pass through\n\n> Mars has two small, irregular moons, Phobos and Deimos; Phobos is slowly spiraling inward and is expected to eventually break apart, likely creating a temporary ring system around the planet\n\n> The planet hosts some of the most extreme landscapes in the solar system, including Olympus Mons, a giant volcano about three times taller than Mount Everest, and Valles Marineris, a canyon system so huge it makes the Grand Canyon look tiny by comparison\n\n> We are still only visitors on Mars, but with every SpaceX Starship mission, we get closer to the day this harsh red desert becomes humanity’s next home",

His daughters go to high school in the Bay Area. And he was asking them, like, 'You know, who are the first few presidents of the United States?' They could name Washington. Then he said, 'Well, what do you know about him? Well, 'He was a slave owner.' 'What else?' Like, OK, that's, maybe you should know more than that.\n\nSlavery is obviously a horrific institution, but we should still know more about George Washington than that.”\n\nSource: @billmaher , @elonmusk",

        "text": "the thing about calling DEI 'economic genocide' is that it undersells it\n\nyes, young White men were systematically excluded from careers during their peak marriage years, but that's just first-order effects.\n\nsecond-order: marriage market collapse. women date across and up. men without careers become invisible to the women who would have married them and disappear. the \"eligible bachelor\" pool shrinks.\n\nthird-order: fertility crisis. fewer marriages, fewer children. but it's worse than just men not marrying or having families. the women who \"won\" the DEI lottery got careers instead of families, delayed fertility until it was too late. DEI attacked family formation from both sides, excluded men from provider roles AND diverted women from their fertility window. everyone lost.\n\nfourth-order: psychological. young men couldn't even name what was happening to them. the same institutions that excluded them told them they were \"privileged\", that complaining was proof of weakness. so they internalized failure as personal inadequacy rather than systemic rigging, retreated into depression, video games, porn. the symptoms we then pathologized as \"male failure\". the system broke them (on purpose) and blamed them for being broken.\n\nfifth-order: institutional trust gone. once you know positions are filled by demographics rather than competence, every credential becomes suspect (if not a priori worthless). is your doctor qualified or a diversity hire? your pilot? your engineer? you can't prove any individual is incompetent, but you can't trust any individual is competent either. medicine skepticism, academic failure, media skepticism, none of this emerged organically. it was manufactured by the DEI hire you can't be sure is qualified to treat you.\n\nsixth-order: reality became unspeakable. noticing any of this was a fireable offense. pointing out the obvious got you called a bigot, deplatformed or fired. pure totalitarian censorship and the problem couldn't even be acknowledged (until now, finally)\nmen knew they were being cheated but couldn't say it. women sensed something was wrong with the men but couldn't identify it. relationships poisoned by a dynamic neither party could name.\n\nseventh-order: the feedback loop. fewer eligible men means more women competing for a shrinking pool, more women losing the marriage market, more resentment, more \"men are trash\", more support for DEI, fewer eligible men and the system accelerates itself.\n\nand the worst part is that DEI was just the economic arm. the same people and institutions pushed the complete package\n\"toxic masculinity\" to pathologize male identity\n\"the future is female\" as explicit zero-sum framing delusion\n\"believe all women\" to weaponize trust against men\n\"men are trash\" to normalize open contempt\na coordinated ideological assault on family formation.\n\nand it even had a business model. HR departments exploded (millions of jobs invented to administer the regime). DEI consultants became a multi-billion dollar industry. politicians got voting blocs dependent on racial grievance. established boomers kept their positions while their competition was eliminated.\n\nthe architects knew what they were doing\nyou don't accidentally build a system that specifically targets men during peak marriage years, tells them they deserve it, makes it unspeakable to complain, attacks their identity as toxic, promotes women into career tracks that burn their fertility, then acts confused when society collapses\n\nif you wanted to suppress the fertility of a specific demographic, engineer the breakdown of trust between the sexes, and make it illegal to notice, the playbook would look exactly like this.\n\nDEI should be held responsible for the fertility crisis, the marriage collapse, the epidemic of male depression and suicide, the destruction of institutional trust, the atomization of society, and the manufactured war between men and women\n\nbut DEI was the weapon\nthe people who designed it, funded it, made it mandatory, enforced it through HR, fired anyone who resisted, called all opposition hate and racism, built careers and industries on its maintenance, they knew. and they're the ones who should be remembered as the architects of one of the worst crimes against humanity",

A low-angle tilted cinematic street-style shot of an empty urban parking lot with cracked asphalt and faded lines, looking up at an anime girl walking forward while carrying a skateboard tucked under one arm, as seen from behind. She wears white baggy cargo pants, a cropped white leather jacket with the xAI Grok logo prominently on the back, a black belt, and white high-top skate shoes, with the worn tread and grip details of one skate shoe dominating the foreground in sharp detail. The skateboard she carries is white with detailed black grip tape, colorful wheels visible. The perspective emphasizes the gritty, urban skate aesthetic with bold foreshortening and a sense of impending action.",

By 2020, I watched non-white colleagues with CVs a tiny fraction as strong as mine absolutely swamped with interview requests and job offers, while I couldn't even secure a preliminary phone interview.\n\nI saw a non-white, female biologists with zero peer-reviewed publications receive a tenure-track job offer from an Ivy League university within minutes of defending her PhD thesis. This would have been utterly incomprehensible in years prior, as such positions are typically only given to well-established academics with a long and very high impact publication record.\n\nTo call this demoralizing would be a dramatic understatement.\n\nCombine my sex and race with the fact that I refused to write the woke DEI statements that most universities had begun requiring, due to my strong moral opposition to DEI ideology, and landing a tenure-track position at a respectable university began to feel like a pipe dream.\n\nI also watched many exceptionally smart and talented white male undergraduates abandon their aspirations of becoming academic scientists. They understood what was happening and chose career paths where success would still be tied to competence rather than sex and race.",
