This causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating great products.” ▫️\n\nSpaceX was valued at $5B in 2013 and he thought if Dragon and Falcon 9 were well executed the business could be worth $15B.\n\nMeanwhile, the company would keep offering secondary sales for employee liquidity and this was his recommendation on whether or not to sell: \n\n▫️ “Below is my advice about selling SpaceX stock or options. No complicated analysis is required, as the rules of thumb are pretty simple. If you believe that SpaceX will execute better than the average public company, then our stock price will continue to appreciate at a rate greater than that of the stock market, which would be the next highest return place to invest money over the long term. Therefore, you should sell only the amount that you need to improve your standard of living in the short to medium term. I do actually recommend selling some amount of stock, even if you are certain it will appreciate, as life is short and a bit more cash can increase fun and reduce stress at home (so long as you don't ratchet up your ongoing personal expenditures proportionately).” ▫️\n\nThe concept of Starlink was unveiled in 2015. The first constellation was launched in 2019.\n\nStarlink is projected to do $20B+ sales next year, steady revenue (on top of world-beating launch business) for a potential IPO to raise $30B at a $1.5T valuation in 2026.\n\nThat will *definitely* limit volatility as a public co to pursue next big tech changes (eg. AI data centre opportunity).",

My last day was after seven hours of flight time landing in Orlando around 11 PM, and I still had a 2 1/2 hour drive home to Jacksonville ahead of me.  This is a use case where FSD Supervised has changed how I use my vehicle.  Previously arriving that late would've meant needing an overnight hotel getting a few hours of sleep, waking up and jumping in the car and driving home the next morning. Driving that late at night was just not safe after a long day of work.  With FSD I have no problem getting in the car and letting the Tesla drive me home with my supervision. My reaction time is slower, I'm tired, but that's where this technology really shines. Unsupervised will change the game even more, but for the time being this technology has already changed the way I live and work.  @Tesla_AI",

Norway stands at 41.50, Denmark at 32.50, and rates fall sharply from there. On raw numbers alone, the UK is an extreme outlier.\n\nThis isn't just statistics - it's a political and cultural flashpoint. \n\nMany argue mass immigration policies and weak border controls have imported cultural conflicts and driven crime spikes. \n\nOthers focus on failures inside the system itself: low conviction rates, collapsed trust in policing, and victim-blaming dynamics that discourage reporting.\n\nComparing rape statistics across countries is notoriously messy. \n\nDefinitions differ, counting methods vary, and reporting incentives are not uniform. \n\nStill, the UK's numbers are difficult to dismiss. High-profile cases, collapsing conviction rates, and growing public anger are pushing the issue into the center of national debate.\n\nCalls are mounting for tougher immigration controls, stronger cultural integration expectations, and major reforms in how sexual violence is investigated and prosecuted. \n\nWhatever the cause, the current trajectory is so obiously unsustainable.\n\nSource: Restore Britain, World Population Review",

A Canadian father, Robert Hoogland, was thrown in prison for trying to prevent his 14-year-old daughter from undergoing permanent medical transition. After schools socially transitioned her behind his back and courts authorized testosterone injections against his wishes, the state stripped him of his parental rights. When he refused to remain silent about the medical risks and the loss of his child, the government moved to silence him by force. https://t.co/3kK4Jotk6n\n\nHoogland was sent to prison for \"contempt of court\" because he defied a gag order that forbade him from referring to his child as his \"daughter\" or using female pronouns. By treating his desperate plea to protect his child as a criminal act, the court signalled that the state, not the parent, owned the child. \n\nThis is nothing less than the criminalization of parenthood in the face of state-sponsored gender ideology.",

        "text": "John Carmack on what he admires about Elon Musk\n\nProgramming legend John Carmack is asked about his relationship with Elon Musk, to which he replies:\n\n“In some ways we have a similar background. We’re almost exactly the same age, have backgrounds programming personal computers, and have even read similar books that have turned us into the people we are today.”\n\nJohn first met Elon when he was building Armadillo Aerospace. Elon visited Armadillo with his right-hand propulsion guy, and the three of them talked about rockets.\n\n“I think in many corners [Elon] does not get the respect he should for being a wealthy person who could just retire,” John says. “He went all-in, and he could’ve gone bust. There’s plenty of athletes or entertainers who had all the money in the world and blew it. [Elon] could’ve been the business case example of that with the things he was doing: space exploration, electrification of transportation, and Solar City type things. These are big, world-level things. And I have a great deal of admiration that he was willing to throw himself so completely into that.”\n\nJohn contrasts this with the way he approached his own aerospace company:\n\n“I was doing Armadillo Aerospace in this tightly-bounded way. It was ‘John’s crazy money’ at the time that had a finite limit on it. It was never going to impact me or my family if it completely failed, and I was still hedging my bets working at id Software at a time when [Elon] had been really all-in. I have a huge amount of respect for that.”\n\nIt also irritates John when people call Elon “just a business guy”:\n\n“Elon was deeply involved in a lot of the [technical] decisions. Not all of them were perfect, but he cared very much about engine material selection and propellant selection. For years he’d be telling me to ‘Get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff. Liquid oxygen is the only proper oxidizer for this.’ And the times that I’ve gone through the factories with him, we talked about very detailed things like how this weld is made or how this subassembly goes together. He’s really in there a very detailed level . . . I worry a lot that he’s stretched too thin. He’s got the Boring Company and Neuralink and Twitter too whereas I know I have limits on how much I can pay attention to.”\n\nJohn continues:\n\n“I look back at my aerospace side of things, and I’m like, ‘I did not go all-in on that.’ I did not commit myself at a level that it would’ve taken to be successful there. And it’s a weird thing having a discussion with him. He’s the richest man in the world right now, but he operates on a level that is still very much in my wheelhouse on the technical side of things.”\n\nVideo source: @lexfridman (2022)",
