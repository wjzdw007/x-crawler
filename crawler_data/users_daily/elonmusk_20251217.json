This causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating great products.” ▫️\n\nSpaceX was valued at $5B in 2013 and he thought if Dragon and Falcon 9 were well executed the business could be worth $15B.\n\nMeanwhile, the company would keep offering secondary sales for employee liquidity and this was his recommendation on whether or not to sell: \n\n▫️ “Below is my advice about selling SpaceX stock or options. No complicated analysis is required, as the rules of thumb are pretty simple. If you believe that SpaceX will execute better than the average public company, then our stock price will continue to appreciate at a rate greater than that of the stock market, which would be the next highest return place to invest money over the long term. Therefore, you should sell only the amount that you need to improve your standard of living in the short to medium term. I do actually recommend selling some amount of stock, even if you are certain it will appreciate, as life is short and a bit more cash can increase fun and reduce stress at home (so long as you don't ratchet up your ongoing personal expenditures proportionately).” ▫️\n\nThe concept of Starlink was unveiled in 2015. The first constellation was launched in 2019.\n\nStarlink is projected to do $20B+ sales next year, steady revenue (on top of world-beating launch business) for a potential IPO to raise $30B at a $1.5T valuation in 2026.\n\nThat will *definitely* limit volatility as a public co to pursue next big tech changes (eg. AI data centre opportunity).",

My last day was after seven hours of flight time landing in Orlando around 11 PM, and I still had a 2 1/2 hour drive home to Jacksonville ahead of me.  This is a use case where FSD Supervised has changed how I use my vehicle.  Previously arriving that late would've meant needing an overnight hotel getting a few hours of sleep, waking up and jumping in the car and driving home the next morning. Driving that late at night was just not safe after a long day of work.  With FSD I have no problem getting in the car and letting the Tesla drive me home with my supervision. My reaction time is slower, I'm tired, but that's where this technology really shines. Unsupervised will change the game even more, but for the time being this technology has already changed the way I live and work.  @Tesla_AI",
