Auditors say eligibility is not checked and access is not controlled. \n\nA state audit revealed Minnesota’s SNAP agency fails basic safeguards. Commissioner Tikki Brown’s agency does not properly determine eligibility, does not follow federal rules, and does not control access to the SNAP payment system. Despite a 174% surge in benefits from 2020 to 2021, Brown falsely claimed fraud was nearly nonexistent using data she later conceded was incorrect. Leadership works remotely half the time while oversight collapses. Taxpayers are funding a system with no guardrails.",
