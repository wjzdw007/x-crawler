Auditors say eligibility is not checked and access is not controlled. \n\nA state audit revealed Minnesota’s SNAP agency fails basic safeguards. Commissioner Tikki Brown’s agency does not properly determine eligibility, does not follow federal rules, and does not control access to the SNAP payment system. Despite a 174% surge in benefits from 2020 to 2021, Brown falsely claimed fraud was nearly nonexistent using data she later conceded was incorrect. Leadership works remotely half the time while oversight collapses. Taxpayers are funding a system with no guardrails.",

I'll get the heat.\"\n\nShe got it.\n\nMilwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan was convicted Thursday of obstructing an official proceeding, a felony carrying up to five years in prison.\n\nShe was acquitted of a misdemeanor charge.\n\nThe facts: In April, FBI and ICE agents arrived at Dugan's courthouse to arrest Eduardo Flores Ruiz, who had been deported in 2013 and was back in the country illegally facing battery charges.\n\nDugan sent the agents down the hall to another office. \n\nWhile they were away, she postponed Flores Ruiz's hearing and personally directed him out a back door.\n\nProsecutors played a recording of Dugan telling her court reporter about the plan. \n\nWhen her clerk asked if she should show the immigrant the exit, Dugan replied: \n\n\"I'll do it. I'll get the heat.\"\n\nAgents chased Flores Ruiz on foot and arrested him outside. \n\nHe was deported in November.\n\nDugan, 66, will lose her judgeship. \n\nWisconsin's constitution bars convicted felons from holding public office.\n\nProsecutor Kelly Brown Watzka: \n\n\"She was a frustrated and angry judge who was fed up, who decided to corruptly take matters into her own hands.\"\n\nThe message is clear: no one is above immigration law. Not even judges.\n\nSource: Washington Post",
