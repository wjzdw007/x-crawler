Auditors say eligibility is not checked and access is not controlled. \n\nA state audit revealed Minnesota’s SNAP agency fails basic safeguards. Commissioner Tikki Brown’s agency does not properly determine eligibility, does not follow federal rules, and does not control access to the SNAP payment system. Despite a 174% surge in benefits from 2020 to 2021, Brown falsely claimed fraud was nearly nonexistent using data she later conceded was incorrect. Leadership works remotely half the time while oversight collapses. Taxpayers are funding a system with no guardrails.",

I'll get the heat.\"\n\nShe got it.\n\nMilwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan was convicted Thursday of obstructing an official proceeding, a felony carrying up to five years in prison.\n\nShe was acquitted of a misdemeanor charge.\n\nThe facts: In April, FBI and ICE agents arrived at Dugan's courthouse to arrest Eduardo Flores Ruiz, who had been deported in 2013 and was back in the country illegally facing battery charges.\n\nDugan sent the agents down the hall to another office. \n\nWhile they were away, she postponed Flores Ruiz's hearing and personally directed him out a back door.\n\nProsecutors played a recording of Dugan telling her court reporter about the plan. \n\nWhen her clerk asked if she should show the immigrant the exit, Dugan replied: \n\n\"I'll do it. I'll get the heat.\"\n\nAgents chased Flores Ruiz on foot and arrested him outside. \n\nHe was deported in November.\n\nDugan, 66, will lose her judgeship. \n\nWisconsin's constitution bars convicted felons from holding public office.\n\nProsecutor Kelly Brown Watzka: \n\n\"She was a frustrated and angry judge who was fed up, who decided to corruptly take matters into her own hands.\"\n\nThe message is clear: no one is above immigration law. Not even judges.\n\nSource: Washington Post",

DOING REAL GOOD IS RARE\n\nElon gave an amazing assessment about giving away money being far more complicated than it looks, especially if the goal is real impact instead of public praise. \n\nHe said the appearance of goodness is easy to buy, but the reality of goodness is not, which is why he keeps his foundation quiet and avoids putting his name on projects. \n\nAccording to Elon, the real challenge is making sure money actually helps people rather than just signaling virtue. \n\nIt is a rare admission in a world where philanthropy is often treated like branding:\n\n“I agree with love of humanity and trying to help our fellow human beings. \n\nBut if you care about the reality of goodness rather than the perception of it, it is very difficult to give away money. \n\nI have a large foundation, but I don’t put my name on it. \n\nThe biggest challenge is giving money away in a way that is truly beneficial. \n\nIt is easy to give money away for the appearance of goodness. \n\nIt is very difficult to give money away for the reality of goodness.”\n\nSource: @nikhilkamathcio @elonmusk",

Most studies claiming to show otherwise are methodological train wrecks, and these same people would be pointing that out if their results didn’t support the narrative.\n\nThere is a strong negative correlation between study quality and observed effect of transition on mental health. When proper controls are present, the studies are longitudinal over a substantial period, and we look at objective measures of mental health like psychiatric hospital visits and suicide attempts rather than self-reports, we see insignificant or even negative effects.\n\nThousands of parents were told some version of “you can have a dead son or living daughter” by medical professionals they trusted, when there was never a good reason to think this is true. It’s a lie on an almost unimaginable scale. It’s so monstrous that it’s hard to face. But we must face it.",
