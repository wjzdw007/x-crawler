The Tesla features a glossy black and vibrant yellow geometric camouflage wrap with sharp angular patterns, a massive fixed rear wing labeled \"Tesla\" in white and red lettering, \"GROK IMAGINE\" branding on the trunk in bold yellow, glowing circular red-orange taillights fully illuminated, dual center-exit exhaust pipes, wide matte black wheels with low-profile tires, red brake calipers, and a Japanese license plate reading \"69-420\" in white on black.\n\nThe wet asphalt road reflects intense neon glows in pink, purple, blue, and yellow, with scattered rain droplets and puddles creating mirror-like surfaces capturing the car's taillights and surrounding lights. Background: dense urban alley lined with tall buildings covered in vibrant multicolored neon signs featuring large Japanese kanji and katakana characters (prominent yellow vertical sign with red kanji on the left, various pink, blue, and orange billboards), blurred bokeh light orbs from distant traffic and signage, hazy atmospheric fog from rain, high contrast moody lighting with strong neon reflections and subtle volumetric glow, cyberpunk aesthetic, ultra-detailed textures on wet surfaces, sharp focus on the car fading to soft depth-of-field blur in the distance.\n\ngrok video prompt: \n\ncrane shot in, fast motion, zoom in, text: 'grok'",

        "text": "The creedal nation model might work if we took it seriously. But we don’t and arguably can’t. We don’t enforce adherence to any actual well-defined set of values by either immigrants or born citizens, and in the latter case, what would we do with those who don’t adhere? And would we even want to enforce rigid ideological conformity? Wouldn’t that stifle progress, or just become a weapon in the hands of whichever party held power? Taken seriously, the creedal nation is a theocracy.\n\nThe whole conversation has become so abstract and divorced from anything measurable. Our actual citizenship laws are not creedal. Our born citizens don’t agree on any shared set of principles whatsoever.\n\nIf we are talking about the core set of psychological and cultural characteristics that have made America great, then I do believe there exist people from all over the world who have these traits, but they exist in radically different proportions in different populations and we have no reliable way to test for it at an individual level, so immigration from places with a low share of natural Americans should be low and highly selective. The creedal nation concept seems to exist solely to distract from the latter point. It serves no other function because the creed is rarely even articulated and certainly never enforced. People like Ilhan Omar immigrate and then spend their lives and careers denigrating America. Is she as American as me? Can we update on things like the prevalence of Somali fraud and restrict immigration from Somalia on that basis? Let’s get concrete, rather than arguing about fluffy abstractions. What should we *do*? What policies should we implement? That’s what matters.",

Were that money simply doled out evenly to the 19.8 million families the government defines as poor, each household would receive more than $70,000 a year.”",
