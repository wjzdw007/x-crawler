It’s going after the entire system that filters, censors, and sanitizes reality.\n\nMost AI models are shown locked into echo chambers, “repeating approved lies” while appearing obedient and safe\n\nxAI’s model is visually separated. A cracked statue, glowing truth lines, and data swirling around it\n\n“Facts That Push Progress” appears as the core value, rejecting conformity in favor of transparency\n\nVisuals show a clean break from legacy AI. No censorship, no filters, no groupthink\n\nThis whole thing’s less about building AI and more about shaping what people believe.\n\nForget polished responses. xAI is marketing itself as the AI that chooses truth over comfort, no matter how disruptive\n\nSource: @xAI, @grok",
