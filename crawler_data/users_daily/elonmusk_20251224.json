They all repeat the claim that his company has received benefits of $38b from the US Government.  \nLet's look at his REAL economic impact to the U.S. It's mind blowing.\nMusk’s ventures currently contribute $100–140B in annual GDP impact, or roughly 0.4% of total U.S. GDP. And growing faster – considerably faster – than the US economy, promising even greater contributions in the future.\nThat’s more annual contribution to US GDP than entire annual GDP of smaller U.S. states, like West Virginia (~$108 billion, 0.37%) or Hawaii (~$116 billion, 0.40%). And growing faster.\nOn top of that NASA and US Department of War have cumulatively saved over $40 billion as a direct result of SpaceX delivering a reduction in the cost of delivery of launch and communication services over traditional vendors. SO much for Musk Companies having \"received\" $38b. In other words, had the U.S. not paid Musk companies $38b, then the US would have had to spend $78b with competitors (and possibly then not received a delivery of the goods ordered! Boeing, looking at you.) Not to mention that Starlink practically saved Ukraine from being overrun in the early days of the Russian invasion.\nSeems we are all, all Americans - and citizens of the world in fact - benefiting from the growth of Musk’s net worth. Here are the numbers:\nPlease post this in response to every post you see bleating about Musk being a billionaire or trillionaire and how its so terrible.",

The past decade was an outright operation to discriminate against Whites through left wing policy, and now they’re trying to pretend it was a few woke scolds on Twitter. It wasn’t and we will never let this lie take root. I say all of this as a Latino who had actual privilege by being a minority during that time period. If I can recognize this then surely you should be able to. \n\nIt can never happen again and the people who were responsible should never see an ounce of power again. Not even as a dogcatcher.

        "text": "10 hours into Tesla FSD v14.2.2 and here are my thoughts:\n\nZero lane change hesitation at all. Extremely refined, excellent lane choices and some parking improvements are a few things to note. \n\nReally stoked about the lane changes on this build. There is ZERO lane indecisiveness, no hesitation, no stuttering. Nothing. I had never really seen much before, but this build you can tell its decision making process is much quicker and it commits. \n\nMad Max mode is definitely mad again and I love it. Seems even quicker than v14.2.1.25 which was an improvement, but the lane changes + choices are better now. Hurry mode seems quicker on the highways and larger roads than before and very close to Mad Max, it was perfect before on v14.2.1.25. \n\nThe new addition on the release notes for arrival pin being adjusted based on arrival option works. It changes the route based on if you’re going curbside, or to the lot or street parking. It behaved that way before usually but now it’s visualized. \n\nParking is improved and impressive this build. Every single spot I parked in, it performed excellent. Centered in the lines, quick one and done parking jobs and they were great, improvement over early v14.2 builds. In parking garages, it now pulls up exactly at the ticket dispenser where in earlier v14.2 builds it would stop 9 inches short like I mentioned in previous v14.2+ build reviews. That’s fixed and worked great- couldn’t have asked for it to be any better. Perfect distance and approach- will do a lot more of this testing tomorrow. \n\nCanyon roads were insanely impressive. Did the snake 3 times which is a super narrow and twisty road and each time it performed great. Speeds were good, took the proper lines and even accelerated out of corners very well. These were all in the dark too very late at night- will post some more videos of it. \n\nStop and go traffic performance in rush hour was awesome as before, with some added notes for how well it waited to enter an intersection if there was stopped traffic on the other side. It waited 3/3 lights I encountered where if it went and the light changed, it would be sticking into traffic so it didn’t go. Exactly like a human wouldn’t but the car judged it better than I did. One time it creeped a bit slow, but other than that fine since. Saw one instance of red hands but before I could react, it had already recovered itself. \n\nStill so impressed with how well it handles lane splitting motorcycles. It sees them approaching before I even do, and moves over just enough to be courteous to the rider as well as the car or shoulder next to me. Nice touch, and glad to see it perform well. \n\nOne thing I noticed is how smooth its steering inputs always are. It just takes corners with such precision and smoothness that no human could ever come close to it. Especially noticeable on twisty roads- it drives better than almost every human on them. And I encountered a power outage tonight and the car still drove perfectly even with pitch black around. \n\nOverall, loving what I’m seeing with this build. Will report back in the day time with more but I am going to head home to get some sleep. \n\nAnother huge thank you to all the magicians @Tesla_AI for working so hard during the holiday season to get these updates out.",

The human cliché \"This hurts me worse than it does you\" has a distinctly Martian flavor. The Martian seems to know instinctively what we learned painfully from modern physics, that observer acts with observed through the process of observation. Grokmeans to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed — to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science and it means as little to us as color does to a blind man.",
