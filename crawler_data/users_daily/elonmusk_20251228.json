        "text": "RE: Fraud in Minnesota\n\nI’m not sure that most Americans understand that in large swathes of humanity, there is no actual concept of “fraud,” particularly fraud against the government.  Instead, there is a belief in the virtue of getting away with what you can to help yourself and your tribe.\n\nI spent a lot of my life in the Middle East and Central Asia, working closely with foreign contractors and foreign governments to provide support to American military operations.  As a US Army officer with a big checkbook courtesy of Uncle Sam, I can’t really count the sheer number of times I was offered bribes to award a contract, or falsify records to do things like create larger (fake) headcounts at places like dining facilities, or to just simply be on the take for future illegal requests.\n\nOf course I had enough sense to never comply with such requests.  Moreover, they were never explicitly structured as “bribes”; instead it was usually along the lines of “Here I have these Rolexes as gifts for you and your wife to show our friendship.”  (Unfortunately, too many US officers and NCOs succumbed to this siren song and ended up breaking rocks in Leavenworth.)\n\nThe weird thing about this to me was that whenever I turned down such an offering, it was treated as a grave insult.  I was the one in the wrong, and not the fraudster trying to bribe me.  They considered it rude that I was in their country and refused to accept how things got done.  After all, why did I not want to help my tribe by helping their tribe?\n\nLet me repeat: in these cultures, FRAUD IS NOT EVEN A CONCEPT.  There is only what helps your tribe.\n\nSuch thought processes are so alien to Americans and much of the West.  We are raised on the presumption that our institutions are valid, that the rule of law always prevails, and that integrity is universal.  We need these presumptions to have working governments and economies, and without those presumptions—without the mental barrier that causes us not to accept outright fraud—our nation would quickly descend into the economic and social hellscape of countries like…. ummm… you know…. SOMALIA!\n\nSo when we import people en masse from cultures that accept bribery and fraud as routine, acceptable ways to advance one’s tribe, we should not be surprised that things like the $8 BILLION fraud schemes of the Somali population in Minnesota happen so easily.\n\nIntroducing a fraud-based culture based on tribalism into America is like introducing some sort of lethal virus into a population that has no natural immunity.  The virus will spread and grow, unchecked, because it is so alien to the host.  Similarly, a culture of fraud is anathema to American thinking, and it must be cut out before it consumes the host.\n\nSo when you see and hear patriotic Americans decrying what is happening in Minnesota or elsewhere, and when they seek deportation of the offenders, it is not “racism,” it is not “bigotry,” it is not “xenophobia”; instead, it is preserving the American tradition of responsible institutions and national integrity.",

THEN THE FRAUD EXPLODED\n\nIn September 2020, James O'Keefe's Project Veritas dropped undercover footage alleging a massive ballot-harvesting racket in Ilhan Omar's Minneapolis district.\n\nPaid operatives illegally scooped absentee ballots from elderly Somali immigrants, stuffing envelopes and even bragging on Snapchat about hauling 300 for City Council hopeful Jamal Osman. \n\nWhistleblower Omar Jamal spilled that it was an \"open secret,\" with Omar's crew like staffer Ali Gainey coordinating the cash-fueled scheme, exploiting vulnerable folks for DFL power plays.\n\nBut media \"fact-checkers\" swarmed, branding it racist kryptonite without debunking evidence, cops claimed no proof, and the story vanished like the Hunter laptop weeks later. \n\nNY Post's Miranda Devine got hammered for covering it, yet fraud festered: \n\nFast-forward to 2025, and Minnesota's drowning in $9B+ Somali-linked scams from Feeding Our Future to Medicaid ghost services, same MO of milking taxpayer programs for riches and votes.\n\nWhy does it keep happening? \n\nIncentives galore, lax election laws, unchecked welfare flows, and bloc voting power keep the cycle spinning for crooks and pols. \n\nGovt needs to gut 'em: Enforce strict voter ID, audit programs ruthlessly, tie aid to citizenship/residency checks, and deport fraudsters.\n\nSlash the rewards, kill the motivation, or watch the \"3rd world\" playbook swallow more states.\n\nSource: NY Post (2020), CBS News, FOX9, @mirandadevine, @JamesOKeefeIII",

However, even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs. Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide.\n\nTo date, the FBI dismantled a $250 million fraud scheme that stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during COVID. The investigation exposed sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network.\n\nThe case led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions. Defendants included Abdiwahab Ahmed Mohamud, Ahmed Ali, Hussein Farah, Abdullahe Nur Jesow, Asha Farhan Hassan, Ousman Camara, and Abdirashid Bixi Dool, each charged for roles ranging from wire fraud to money laundering and conspiracy.\n\nThese criminals didn’t just engaged in historic fraud, but tried to subvert justice as well. Abdimajid Mohamed Nur and others were charged for attempting to bribe a juror with $120,000 in cash. Those responsible pleaded guilty and were sentenced, including a 10-year prison term and nearly $48 million in restitution in related cases.\n\nThe FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg. We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing.\n\nFurthermore, many are also being referred to immigrations officials for possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings where eligible.",
