        "text": "🇨🇳 CHINA'S MAGLEV HITS 700 KM/H IN 2 SECONDS - PLANNING 1,000 KM/H - WHILE AMERICA ARGUES ABOUT FIXING POTHOLES\n\nChina just tested a maglev platform that accelerates to 700 km/h (435 mph) in 2 seconds. Target speed: 1,000 km/h (621 mph). That's faster than commercial aircraft. On the ground.\n\nThe acceleration alone is borderline violent - 0 to 435 mph in two seconds is 9.8g. Fighter jet territory. Passengers would need specialized seating just to survive the launch.\n\nBut let's address reality: This is a test platform. Prototype speeds don't mean operational trains. China announces ambitious projects constantly. Some materialize (their existing 430 km/h maglev in Shanghai works). Others disappear quietly.\n\nThe pattern though? They're attempting scale nobody else is. High-speed rail connecting every major city. Maglev research pushed to extremes. Infrastructure spending that makes Western investment look microscopic.\n\nMeanwhile in America: Amtrak averages 105 km/h between cities. California's high-speed rail project started in 2008, burned $10+ billion, and hasn't moved a passenger. The fastest train in the U.S. hits 240 km/h for exactly one 54-mile stretch.\n\nChina's going for 1,000 km/h. Even if they only achieve 800 km/h operationally, that's still triple America's maximum.\n\nHere's why this matters beyond trains: Infrastructure capacity signals industrial capability. \n\nIf China can build and operate 1,000 km/h trains, they can manufacture the precision components, power systems, and control mechanisms that transfer to aerospace, military, and manufacturing.\n\nThe U.S. won the 20th century partly because it built the Interstate Highway System when others couldn't. \n\nChina's betting the 21st century winner will be whoever builds impossible infrastructure first.\n\nThey might fail. Engineering challenges at 1,000 km/h are extreme - air resistance, track precision, emergency braking, passenger safety. \n\nBut they're trying while America argues whether to fix the L train in New York.\n\nEven Chinese failure puts them ahead. You learn more from attempting the impossible than from successfully maintaining mediocrity.\n\nSource: Xinhua, CGTN",

We can do this by allying with all of our most competent builders to get where we want to go, harnessing their talent, not by scapegoating them.",

Audit Ohio now. And I'm pushing for that in every single state!\"\n\n\"The state will, as long as the doctor has approved it, continue to pay you. It could be for 10 hours, 12 hours, up to 24 when it's critical care.\"\n\n\"So you could sit at home without caring for an elderly parent who really doesn't need it, make about $75,000 to $90,000 a year. Now you add two parents, that's $180,000. Now you add your in-laws $250,000.\"\n\n\"You continue to add this and you wonder what are the services being provided? So a lot of providers came and said fraud is occurring because we said we weren't going to rubber stamp this paperwork.\"\n\n\"So they went to other providers, their home health care networks saying we'll make it worth your while. Well, sounds like a kickback to me.\"\n\n\"So we really need to investigate the Medicaid system and how much it's increased since the Somalian population came and who really needs critical care because that's meant for our disabled, our elderly and people who really need it, not to just live off our system.\"\n\n\"And that's what's happening in Ohio. I think it's ridiculous. I think it's despicable, but authorities are now looking at it from the Attorney General's office to the U.S. Attorney's office.\"\n\n\"I flagged them all because this is Ohio tax dollars and we have to take it seriously. I'm tired of people telling me, well, this is the way it's always been. It's subjective and we can't really check. No, you can.\" @MehekCooke",

This is a demographic that doesn't vote, and rarely checks their mail.\n\nUnsolicited ballots will be automatically sent to every single tenant or resident registered to that building, going back a decade or longer. So a 100 unit apartment building could receive 5x as many ballots, most of which litter the mail room floor. \n\nActivist groups like Arabella recruit low-income residents to collect these ballots, and pay them for every completed ballot, without oversight or accountability. \n\nSo these recruits can either laboriously track down the intended recipients and encourage them to vote legally, OR they can collect as many blank ballots as possible, and fill them all out themselves, knowing they'll make $1,000s, and it's virtually impossible to get caught. \n   \nThese ballots end up in the mail or in a dropbox, where they will be counted alongside legitimate ballots, having never been verified or signature-matched.\n\nIt doesn't take a grand conspiracy, as the participant pawns are incentivized monetarily to cheat on their own accord.  \n\nAnd there's no legal recourse, as the big money organizers have plausible deniability because they don't need to instruct or bear witness to any of the cheating.",

Because they are wittingly engaged in a scheme to let the illegals vote, which allows them to stay in power, which allows them to continue to steal our tax dollars.\n\nIt’s all one giant racket, an We the People are the suckers.",
