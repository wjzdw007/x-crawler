        "text": "🇨🇳 CHINA'S MAGLEV HITS 700 KM/H IN 2 SECONDS - PLANNING 1,000 KM/H - WHILE AMERICA ARGUES ABOUT FIXING POTHOLES\n\nChina just tested a maglev platform that accelerates to 700 km/h (435 mph) in 2 seconds. Target speed: 1,000 km/h (621 mph). That's faster than commercial aircraft. On the ground.\n\nThe acceleration alone is borderline violent - 0 to 435 mph in two seconds is 9.8g. Fighter jet territory. Passengers would need specialized seating just to survive the launch.\n\nBut let's address reality: This is a test platform. Prototype speeds don't mean operational trains. China announces ambitious projects constantly. Some materialize (their existing 430 km/h maglev in Shanghai works). Others disappear quietly.\n\nThe pattern though? They're attempting scale nobody else is. High-speed rail connecting every major city. Maglev research pushed to extremes. Infrastructure spending that makes Western investment look microscopic.\n\nMeanwhile in America: Amtrak averages 105 km/h between cities. California's high-speed rail project started in 2008, burned $10+ billion, and hasn't moved a passenger. The fastest train in the U.S. hits 240 km/h for exactly one 54-mile stretch.\n\nChina's going for 1,000 km/h. Even if they only achieve 800 km/h operationally, that's still triple America's maximum.\n\nHere's why this matters beyond trains: Infrastructure capacity signals industrial capability. \n\nIf China can build and operate 1,000 km/h trains, they can manufacture the precision components, power systems, and control mechanisms that transfer to aerospace, military, and manufacturing.\n\nThe U.S. won the 20th century partly because it built the Interstate Highway System when others couldn't. \n\nChina's betting the 21st century winner will be whoever builds impossible infrastructure first.\n\nThey might fail. Engineering challenges at 1,000 km/h are extreme - air resistance, track precision, emergency braking, passenger safety. \n\nBut they're trying while America argues whether to fix the L train in New York.\n\nEven Chinese failure puts them ahead. You learn more from attempting the impossible than from successfully maintaining mediocrity.\n\nSource: Xinhua, CGTN",

It’s not only unethical, unconstitutional and unAmerican to seize assets.\n\nBut this sort of bill would break everything, halt tons of hiring and investment, and lead to mass poverty for the middle and working class, and you know it - you’re just grandstanding for low-IQ or angry leftists.\n\nWe do need to fix things in our country but the way we do that is competence and cutting waste and actually using the money on education and healthcare more effectively to lift up lives.  We can do this by allying with all of our most competent builders to get where we want to go, harnessing their talent, not by scapegoating them.",
