          "text": "Compare these two @Wikipedia entries—\"Tommy Robinson\" and \"Alaa Abd El-Fattah.\" It's a masterclass in information manipulation.\n\nTwo entries. Two British men (in El-Fattah's case, at least nominally). Both subject of UK government action. Yet the entries could not be more different. \n\nThe first sentence of the Wikipedia article on Alaa Abd El-Fattah describes him as \"an Egyptian-British software developer, blogger, political activist and former political prisoner.\" \n\nSounds lovely!\n\nThe lead goes on to tell a heart-rending story about the persecution of a valiant freedom fighter. According to Wikipedia, El-Fattah was imprisoned for staging political protests. He protected women at a rally from police violence. He's a blogger, a software developer, an inspired political polemicist. A wonderful son. A father who missed his child. He even won prestigious awards!\n\nThe lead makes no mention of the fact that El-Fattah, has incited the murder of Jews, whites, British police officers, and children—including the torture of their mothers. It doesn't mention his Holocaust denial or his homophobia.\n\nHere's just a sample of what El-Fattah has written over the years:\n\n+ “If we can’t kill the police officers, let us find a terrorist cell to kill their children and torture their mothers”\n\n+ \"The Islamic Group was right. We must kill all police.\"\n\n+ \"No medicine can reverse God's will. He should subject his anger at [God] for creating those dirty homosexual[s'].\"\n\nDespite this, the Wikipedia article's all-important lead section makes no mention of El-Fattah's vile hatred of gays or his open support for ISIS. Instead, you get a tiny little sentence at the very bottom of the lead about \"controversial\" social media posts. \n\nThis is what AIs train on and what @Google feeds to the public. \n\nIndeed, Google actually quotes the first sentence of the Wikipedia article directly in its \"Knowledge Panel\" about El-Fattah. Ask Google \"Who is Alaa Abd El-Fattah?\" and the response is word-for-word pulled from Wikipedia: \"Egyptian-British software developer, blogger, political activist and former political prisoner.\"\n\nNow look at the entry on Tommy Robinson. The  very first, defining sentence calls Robinson \"a British far-right activist and one of the UK's most prominent anti-Islam campaigners. Robinson has a history of criminal convictions.\"\n\nWow—what a difference a political (or religious?) affiliation makes! But don't stop there. \n\nThe next paragraph calls Robinson a \"fascist,\" using Wikivoice to assert this as fact, not perspective or opinion. \n\nThe rest of the lead is basically a rap sheet beaten into encyclopedia form. It includes not just a litany of convictions but also cites open, ongoing investigations. (So much for Wikipedia's beloved presumption of innocence.)\n\nRobinson's entry has unsubstantiated allegations that he is a Kremlin agent, that he spread Russian disinformation, and that he promulgates COVID conspiracy theories. \n\nThe Wikipedia entry is a dossier and hit piece all wrapped up into one neat little informational package. The framing is alarming, the sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. \n\nBut for the jihadist who wants people like me (and, probably, you) murdered? It's a lovefest.\n \nThis isn't just about Wikipedia. It's how the information ecosystem works—how a politically motivated view of \"truth\" gets concretized into plain \"fact.\" This is just one example, but there are thousands more like it.\n\nFor more Wikipedia investigation, follow @npovmedia.",

Now the question is whether Silicon Valley backing can turn one viral investigation into a coordinated nationwide blitz.\n\nSource: @chamath, ZeroHedge",

If you’ve got value, make people pay for it.\n\nElon is actively laying out the next evolution of X as a creator-oriented platform, one that doesn’t only reward virality, but also sustainable income streams.\n\nIf you’re a creator, journalist, filmmaker, meme lord, or anyone dropping consistent value here, it’s time to think like a digital entrepreneur.\n\nThe message is clear: Build the audience, drop the teaser, and monetize the payoff.\n\nThis is X 2.0, and it’s not just for takes anymore.\n\n“I recommend taking this approach for text/image/video content on X.”\n\nSource: @elonmusk, @ToscaMusk",

If they’re here illegally, deport them immediately; if they’re naturalized citizens, revoke their citizenship and deport them quickly thereafter. If we need to change the law to do that, I will. Our nation will not tolerate those who take advantage of our charity and refuse to assimilate into our culture. Additionally, if any naturalized Somalis had undisclosed ties to terrorist organizations like Al-Shabaab, I want to see their citizenship revoked and their asses sent back immediately. Same goes for anyone who is found to have committed marriage fraud during the immigration process.”",

          "text": "I get why people want a billionaire tax... The anger isn't irrational; it's a response to a system that feels rigged to some.\n\nWhen someone worth $10 billion pays a lower effective tax rate than a schoolteacher, something feels wrong, and the system isn't broken by accident, it's working exactly as designed, and that design can be rethought!\n\nIf people knew the actual mechanics of how taxes work they would probably be even angrier. If Jensen Huang passed away tomorrow, it would be insanely sad, and-\nHis estate would pay roughly 40% in federal estate taxes, though with the right setup a lot of that could be avoided. His kids would inherit the remaining tens of billions in Nvidia stock with the cost basis reset to current value, erasing all the appreciation for tax purposes. They could then borrow $100M a year against it, and never pay income tax on any of it. It doesn't feel fair to the teacher paying income tax on every dollar or the software engineer taking home 55% of their paycheck. The frustration is  justified.\n\nIt feels unfair to the teacher paying taxes on every dollar and the software engineer taking home 55% of their paycheck (California wtf!). The frustration people feel around that is justified! I think I pay too much in taxes too! But we have to pay them, and I think we should strive to build a tax system that is more fair.\n\nBut California's \"one-time 5% billionaire wealth tax\" is a terrible way to go about it\nIt doesn't stop the borrow-die-inherit cycle\nIt forces an exodus of exactly the wrong people\nIt creates perverse incentives without fixing any underlying problems. \n\nMost people seem to have not read the act - here it is: https://t.co/DedQND6Rc9\nit's bad and poorly written.\n\nIt's a residency trap. Pick a date, pick a line, and you create one giant incentive to leave. You only need a few top taxpayers to go (sounds like Thiel and Brin are getting ready), and California loses years of income tax, capital gains, and the gravity that keeps companies anchored here.\n\nIt unfairly punishes the wrong people. A founder with $1B on paper in a Series E startup isn't actually rich yet, that company could go to zero, they can't sell without losing control, and they're still working. A wealth tax forces them to find cash they don't have... you can say \"they could sell shares\" but not every company is even liquid enough to do that. Meanwhile, someone already liquid can structure around it with better lawyers.\n\nThe cheering from @RoKhanna \"I will miss them very much\" is shortsighted. Celebrating capital flight is celebrating a smaller tax base and bigger deficits. People who start companies are the growth engine of our state and country. Making them your enemy isn't progressive, it's self-defeating.\n\nThere's also a practical problem: net worth isn't a clean number. Public stock is easy. Everything else becomes a valuation fight. You'll create a cottage industry of appraisals and litigation.\n\nIf we want to address the unfairness, target the specific moves that make the system feel rigged.\n\nTwo ideas that actually map to the problem and are palatable IMO:\n\n1. Tax large loans against appreciated stock above a high threshold (say $10M). If someone borrows $50M against stock to fund consumption, that's functionally income. This targets the \"borrow to avoid taxes\" play directly.\n\n2. End step-up in basis for large inheritances (say above $10M here too). Step-up basis is why \"they never pay.\" Ending it at high levels keeps incentives for entrepreneurship while reducing dynastic wealth transfers that were never taxed.\n\nThose approaches don't punish illiquid founders. They tax moments when wealth turns into spendable cash, and they tax gains that would otherwise be erased.\n\nTBH I don't know if $10M is the right number, just throwing a number out there that seems in the ballpark.\n\nFinally - before we invent new taxes with big second-order effects, we need get our house in order. Middle-class people still pay enormous amounts in taxes, and we are wasting it. I'm not sure that 20% of the budget is fraud (what @elonmusk says) but we definitely have a bloated budget, both federally and in California. As we know from DOGE, it's really hard to fix. In California there is a lot of low hanging fruit though... we need to cut what isn't working and stop treating every problem with \"we just need a new tax on a small group to make it work\"\n\nI'm not against wealthy people paying their fair share, and I don't think most of us are! I am against feel-good policy that backfires, shrinks the base, and makes the state less competitive. If we want fairness and a tax system people trust, we should go after unfair loopholes, not a headline.",
