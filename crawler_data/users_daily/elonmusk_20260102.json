Still New York City.\n\nMigrants still paid cartels to get to the border. \n\nBut once they cross, American taxpayers picked up the tab for everything the cartels used to charge for on this side.\n\nSource: @juliandorey @nickshirleyy",

Now Washington.\n\nCitizen journalist Cam Higby uncovered what appears to be the same playbook operating in Washington State.\n\nAmira Child Care LLC, owned by Ahmed Amira and listed as Somali-speaking, donated $1,000 cash in 2021 to Shukri Olow, a Somali-born candidate for King County Council and Washington State House.\n\nThat donation triggered a Public Disclosure Commission investigation.\n\nPDC Case #96266 alleged Olow's campaign accepted contributions exceeding statutory limits. \n\nThe case was closed with a \"reminder\" after Olow refunded the over-limit portions. \n\nThe PDC noted she was a \"first-time candidate.\" \n\nThe timing and amount, $1,000 in 2021, align with the reported violations.\n\nNow follow the money:\n\n2021-2023: Ahmed Amira Abdi received $383,000 in grants from the Department of Children, Youth and Families.\n\n2023-2025: Amira Child Care LLC received $363,000.\n\nJuly-November 2025 alone: $355,000. \n\nDecember not yet reported.\n\nThe math doesn't add up.\n\nLicensed capacity: 12 children. \n\nCurrently enrolled: 7 children.\n\nSeptember 2025 payment: $81,263. \n\nThat's $11,600 per child for one month.\n\nHigby's conclusion: \n\n\"What it appears to be is a child care organization owned by a Somali person donating to Somali political candidates with taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nThree states. Same pattern. Massive subsidies. \n\nHow deep does this go?\n\nSource: @camhigby / Washington PDC Case #96266",

        "text": "🧠 Why Neuralink is a game-changer for people with disabilities:\nFor millions living with paralysis, ALS, or severe motor/speech impairment, simple things like using a computer, communicating, or creating are impossible without constant help.\nNeuralink’s brain implant changes that—letting users control devices purely with thoughts.\n\nNoland, paralyzed below the shoulders from a diving accident, used to rely on a painful mouth stick and family caregivers. Now he independently browses, plays games like Civilization, and studies math, philosophy, & languages daily—reclaiming his autonomy and planning to return to school.\n\nAlex, quadriplegic after a car crash, lost his passion for designing auto parts. With Neuralink, he’s back to 3D CAD modeling, graphics, and even coding—pushing creative boundaries again.\n\nBrad, in late-stage ALS and unable to speak/move, was trapped indoors by unreliable eye-tracking tech. Now he communicates outdoors, attends his kid’s soccer games, and dreams of travel.\n\nThis isn’t sci-fi. Real patients are already living more independent, connected lives. \nFuture steps: robotic arms, speech restoration, even vision.\nNeuralink restores dignity, freedom, and hope. It’s one of the most important advancements for the disabled today.",

          "text": "Trump admin. halts child care payments nationwide until states provide evidence of legitimate spending | Blake Wolf, One America News Network\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that the Trump administration is freezing federal child care funding to every single U.S. state after introducing a freeze on Minnesota’s program — in response to ongoing allegations and evidence of widespread fraud.\n\nOn Wednesday, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told ABC News that states will receive the funds “only when states prove they are being spent legitimately.” Future payments now require prior justification, receipts, or photo evidence to verify legitimate spending before funds are released.\n\nThe announcement is in response to a report released by independent journalist Nick Shirley last week. Shirley claimed to have exposed $110 million in fraud during his investigation, after going to several daycare centers in Minneapolis, collecting millions in state and federal funds, only to find the locations desolate.\n\nNixon told the outlet that funding recipients “not suspected of fraudulent activity” are being instructed to send their “administrative data” to HHS for review. \n\n“It’s the onus of the state to make sure that these funds, these federal dollars, taxpayer dollars, are being used for legitimate purposes,” he continued, noting that funding recipients “suspected of fraudulent activity” are obligated to provide the federal government with additional documentation such as “attendance records, licensing, inspection and monitoring reports, complaints and investigations.” \n\nWednesday’s announcement follows HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill’s Tuesday statement pausing all child care payments to the state of Minnesota.\n\nO’Neill made the announcement in an X post, announcing three actions the department is taking to root out the “blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country.” \n\nExplaining the changes, O’Neill stated that all Administration for Children & Families (ACF) payments “across America will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.” \n\nO’Neill went on to demand a comprehensive audit of the Minnesota-based daycare centers, including “attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations, and inspections.” \n\n“We have launched a dedicated fraud-reporting hotline and email address at https://t.co/skW0b4R4Ec Whether you are a parent, provider, or member of the general public, we want to hear from you,” he added. “We have turned off the money spigot and we are funding the fraud.” \n\nAlongside additional guardrails placed by HHS, the fraud is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the FBI, according to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel. \n\n“Homeland Security Investigations are on the ground in Minneapolis right now conducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud,” Noem wrote in an X post on Monday.\n\nPatel also revealed that the bureau has “surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs” on Sunday, going on to discuss the FBI’s work in securing indictments and convictions in connection to Minnesota’s $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud scheme. \n\n“The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg. We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing. Furthermore, many are also being referred to immigration officials for possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings where eligible,” Patel added.\n\nhttps://t.co/1gfWx4QA7W",
