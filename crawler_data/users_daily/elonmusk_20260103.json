We were running a number of rogue USAID operations in Cuba at the time.\n\nUSAID pumped $1.2 billion in, and we sponsored these activist groups and these civil society organizations to learn how to use Facebook, learn how to use Twitter, learn how to use hashtags, and learn how to coordinate street protests so that everyone knew where to go, which streets to show up on, and what slogans to use in order to create the pro-democracy predicate for it.\n\nYou’re using Cayman Islands bank accounts. You’re saying it’s earmarked for Pakistani aid. But the money was never sent to Pakistan—it was sent to the Cayman Islands to fund this whole operation.”",

It was just the nastiest place you could imagine. I lived in it too and showered at the YMCA. This lasted for about three or four months, and the reason we chose this office — in addition to it being really cheap — was that there was an internet service provider on the floor below. So we were able to get really cheap internet access by drilling a hole in the floor and connecting to their server directly.”\n\nIn February 1999 — less than a year after this interview — Compaq would purchase Zip2 for $307 million in cash.\n\nThe interviewer also asks Elon what he thinks the future of the Internet will be, to which Elon responds:\n\n“I think the internet is the superset of all media. It is the be all and end all of media. One will see print, broadcast, radio — essentially all media — folding into the internet. What the internet amounts to is it’s the first two-way communication medium that is intelligent. It allows consumers to choose what they want to see, when they want to see it.”",

It’s that it becomes illegal six ways from Sunday to do anything.”\n\nSource: @teslaownersSV",

I have a saying, which is physics is the law and everything else is a recommendation. I'm not suggesting people break the laws made by humans, we should generally obey the laws of humans. But I've seen many people break human made laws, but I have not seen anyone break the laws of physics. \n\nSo, for any given AI, grounding it against reality and reality, for example, as you mentioned with the car, it needs to drive safely and correctly. The humanoid robot Optimus needs to perform the task that it's being asked to perform. These are things that are very helpful for ensuring that the model is truthful and accurate because it has to adhere to the laws of physics. So I think that's actually maybe somewhat overlooked or at least not talked about enough is that to really be intelligent it's got to make predictions that are in line with reality. In other words, physics.”\n\nConversation with Satya Nadella, May 19, 2025",

It’s about access to decision makers, business leaders, and highly engaged readers in the same place, at the same time. \n\nThat’s why independent journalism didn’t just survive the collapse of trust in corporate media.\n\nIt moved to X and took the audience with it.\n\n“It’s no question that X is the platform with the greatest reach. \n\nAnd when I say the greatest reach, it’s not just the numbers, but the individuals you can have contact with, whether it’s people very senior in politics or major business leaders. \n\nWe were super thrilled when Elon Musk subscribed to our account.\n\nThat was a huge compliment. \n\nIt’s not just the size of the audience, it’s the diversity of the audience and being able to reach a lot of different types of people. \n\nThe powerful, the decision makers, but also everyday consumers of information. \n\nOn X, the people following the account are far more engaged in the news. \n\nThey’re super consumers of information. \n\nYou can’t argue with the numbers.”\n\nSource: @C__Herridge",
