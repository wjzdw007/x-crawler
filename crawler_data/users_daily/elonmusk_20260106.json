These included issues like inadequate supervision, safety hazards, and record-keeping failures.\n\nThe center reopened the very next day, October 2, 2025, under the new name Super Kids Daycare at the same address, using what appears to be the same or a transferred license.\n\nIn fiscal year 2025 (which ran from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025), Super Kids Daycare received approximately $2.45 million in payments through Minnesota's Child Care Assistance Program. \n\nWho is the owner of this \"daycare\"?\nState Sen. Omar Fateh's brother-in-law, Mohamud Muse.\n\nMuse, who volunteered for the campaign of DFL State Sen. Omar Fateh (his brother-in-law), admitted to collecting ballots from voters but falsely denied under oath that he had paid or coerced anyone. He was convicted in May 2022 of one count of perjury for lying to a federal grand jury about his role in handling and delivering absentee ballots during the August 2020 primary election in Minneapolis.",

It's confirmed.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has verified reporting that Abukar Dahir Osman, Somalia's Ambassador to the United Nations, was involved in a healthcare company convicted of Medicaid fraud.\n\nHis company's NPI appears on the HHS Office of Inspector General exclusion list under code 1128a1, meaning conviction of program-related crimes with a mandatory minimum 5-year exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThis is the same man who just assumed the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council on January 1st.\n\nHe now has authority to set the global agenda, oversee international peacekeeping operations, and authorize UN military actions.\n\nHis background:\n\nReportedly worked as a supervisor at the Medicaid office in Franklin County, Ohio. \n\nListed as a daycare administrator in the state. Connected to a healthcare company convicted of defrauding American taxpayers.\n\nThe same pattern. Medicaid. Daycares. \n\nSomali networks. Fraud convictions.\n\nExcept this one didn't just cash out and disappear. \n\nHe became a diplomat with immunity presiding over global security.\n\nSource: @HHS_Jim",

What I found shocked me: daycare centers receiving millions in tax-exempt CCAP funding, yet neighbors say they’ve never seen a single child inside. Locked doors. Blacked-out windows. No access. No transparency. This isn’t a rumor — it’s a pattern.\n\nI’ve been investigating this since last June. What started as a demographic story turned into something far bigger. People on the ground kept telling me the same thing: fraud was happening in plain sight. Churches turning into mosques. New “daycares” popping up everywhere. And behind it all — millions of dollars flowing with zero oversight.\n\nWhen I arrived in Minnesota, the first daycare told the whole story. Windows completely blacked out. Doors locked. No way to enter. These places literally had signs that said learing instead learning. Ask yourself — what legitimate business operates like that while collecting millions in welfare funds?",

        "text": "My Venezuela experience as head of trading in the region for Cargill.   \n\nCargill was/is the leading producer of critical staple ingredients such as flour, pasta, vegetable oil, and rice in VZ.   I am not saying I agree with grabbing the dictator, but I did have a front row seat to the damage a kleptocracy did to innocent people.  \n1.   The government took over our \"minute rice\" facility at gunpoint because we were \"gouging\"   the nation's poor.   The government was never able to run the plant.  It never ran again.   It was returned years later with no equipment inside\n2.  There are 1000's of generals in the army.   They are each given a slice of the economy to loot.    The large number of generals made it difficult to organize a coup against the regime.\n3.  The government opened grocery stores and sold staples below the cost we sold them to the government.  In theory they used petro oil money to lower grocery prices.   Our regular grocery outlets were forced out of business.  When the government demanded we sell them products below cost we simply had to shut down.   The populous became ever more dependent on the government handouts.   (PS this is the mayor of New York City's proposal.\n4.  Dollars- We needed dollars to go buy raw materials like wheat from places like the US and Canada.   The government would periodically allocate us some dollars that could only be spent for raw materials and freight.  Eventually only the local companies that can and would pay bribes got dollar allocations.   We had several facilities closed for lack of raw material\n5.  My employees liked working for Cargill.  The office was an armed compound with access to a gym, high speed internet, global communications, and a weekly box of basic staples.  Cargill provided a safe and secure environment if only for the working hours.\n6.  Employees became very close to others inside the apartment building.   Going out on the street with a desperate population was not advisable.\n7.  I needed wood pallets for feed.   We tried to export wood pallets to swap for grain.   We refused to pay the bribes it would take to export the pallets\n8.   I once tried to set up a closed loop wheat planting to flour mill supply chain.  A.   They came and stole all the seed wheat for food.   When we tried to ship in seed wheat in containers via US donors there was no way to get it out of the port without it being stolen\n9.  Livestock- Our feed business completely collapsed.   Even if you could raise a pig, you couldn't defend it from being stolen.   People with guns were hungry.\n10.  Employees- In the end my highly skilled team alone with other highly educated people chose to leave.   Cargill often found jobs for them in other Latin countries.    The regime was more than happy to see the well-educated leave the country.  Setting these employees up with high quality stable jobs after fleeing remains one of the best things I ever did in my career.   No one remembers millions in trading earnings.\n\nThis is a short list.  In my opinion the first money spent needs to happen now and it needs to be food.   The US is already on the clock.   The current regime does not care if it starves the population.   The orgy of theft will actually accelerate if they believe their days are numbered.     VZ should be an outstanding customer of US grown ag products.   Rice, bread wheat, veg oil ect.    Feed the people first.\n\nJeff Kazin\nFormer head trading Cargill",

Two days later their CEO called and refused to hire me, citing my ousting from the Nashville Symphony six years ago for resisting DEI as the reason, and instead gave the job to my runner-up, an obvious DEI hire who’s still in college. \n\nIn response I sued the Knoxville Symphony two weeks ago for a year’s salary plus $25k for the 100 hours I spent practicing for the audition. This isn’t just about money though, it’s also about pushing back against these symphony CEOs who continue to put race and politics above merit and skill. Someone has to save our symphonies from being sacrificed on the altar of “diversity” and no one is better positioned to do it than me. Wish I didn’t have to do it but I’m doing it anyway. \n\nI was excited to take the stage with the Knoxville Symphony but instead I’ll see them in court. If Knoxville thought I’d walk away from this they were sorely mistaken.",

They could say they have 9 people living in an apartment. They're going to send them 9 ballots and then they have someone who comes along and collects all the ballots.”\n\n“You're talking probably 100,000 or more people, and they're all living rent free. They're driving a vehicle that you paid for. They're eating food that you paid for. Everything they do is something that you paid for.”\n\n“They all vote together and there's ballot harvesting”",
