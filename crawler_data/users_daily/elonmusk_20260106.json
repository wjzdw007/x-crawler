These included issues like inadequate supervision, safety hazards, and record-keeping failures.\n\nThe center reopened the very next day, October 2, 2025, under the new name Super Kids Daycare at the same address, using what appears to be the same or a transferred license.\n\nIn fiscal year 2025 (which ran from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025), Super Kids Daycare received approximately $2.45 million in payments through Minnesota's Child Care Assistance Program. \n\nWho is the owner of this \"daycare\"?\nState Sen. Omar Fateh's brother-in-law, Mohamud Muse.\n\nMuse, who volunteered for the campaign of DFL State Sen. Omar Fateh (his brother-in-law), admitted to collecting ballots from voters but falsely denied under oath that he had paid or coerced anyone. He was convicted in May 2022 of one count of perjury for lying to a federal grand jury about his role in handling and delivering absentee ballots during the August 2020 primary election in Minneapolis.",

It's confirmed.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has verified reporting that Abukar Dahir Osman, Somalia's Ambassador to the United Nations, was involved in a healthcare company convicted of Medicaid fraud.\n\nHis company's NPI appears on the HHS Office of Inspector General exclusion list under code 1128a1, meaning conviction of program-related crimes with a mandatory minimum 5-year exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThis is the same man who just assumed the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council on January 1st.\n\nHe now has authority to set the global agenda, oversee international peacekeeping operations, and authorize UN military actions.\n\nHis background:\n\nReportedly worked as a supervisor at the Medicaid office in Franklin County, Ohio. \n\nListed as a daycare administrator in the state. Connected to a healthcare company convicted of defrauding American taxpayers.\n\nThe same pattern. Medicaid. Daycares. \n\nSomali networks. Fraud convictions.\n\nExcept this one didn't just cash out and disappear. \n\nHe became a diplomat with immunity presiding over global security.\n\nSource: @HHS_Jim",
