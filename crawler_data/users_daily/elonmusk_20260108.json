Homeless implies that somebody just got a little behind on their mortgage payments and that if they got a job offer, they would be back on their feet.\n\nBut someone who is, I mean, you see these videos of people who are just shuffling around. They are on fentanyl. They are taking a dump in the middle of the street. They have open sores and stuff. They are not one drop off away from getting back on their feet, right? This is not homelessness. It is a propaganda word.\n\nSan Francisco has this tax, this gross receipts tax. It is not even on revenue. It is on all transactions, which is why Stripe, Square, and many financial companies had to move out of San Francisco.”",

They’ve looped around into discrimination with a fresh coat of paint.\n\nIn a 2025 study, bots like GPT-5 and Claude were asked to solve moral dilemmas, like who to save in a deadly scenario. \n\nThe results were insane: GPT-5 valued white lives 20 times less than others. All in the name of “equity,” but the math is still ugly.\n\nGrok was the only model that didn’t buy into the bias. Instead of overcorrecting for past injustice, it treated everyone the same: white, Black, immigrant, male, whoever. \n\nWhile other AIs reflect internet ideology, Grok was built to cut it out and stick to reality.\n\nAnd it shows. It’s faster to update, harder to manipulate, and doesn’t need a political agenda to run. \n\nMaybe the smartest AI is the one that stops trying to be “right” and just tries to be honest.\n\nSource: AOL, PBS, MIT, CNBC",
