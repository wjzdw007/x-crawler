Homeless implies that somebody just got a little behind on their mortgage payments and that if they got a job offer, they would be back on their feet.\n\nBut someone who is, I mean, you see these videos of people who are just shuffling around. They are on fentanyl. They are taking a dump in the middle of the street. They have open sores and stuff. They are not one drop off away from getting back on their feet, right? This is not homelessness. It is a propaganda word.\n\nSan Francisco has this tax, this gross receipts tax. It is not even on revenue. It is on all transactions, which is why Stripe, Square, and many financial companies had to move out of San Francisco.”",

They’ve looped around into discrimination with a fresh coat of paint.\n\nIn a 2025 study, bots like GPT-5 and Claude were asked to solve moral dilemmas, like who to save in a deadly scenario. \n\nThe results were insane: GPT-5 valued white lives 20 times less than others. All in the name of “equity,” but the math is still ugly.\n\nGrok was the only model that didn’t buy into the bias. Instead of overcorrecting for past injustice, it treated everyone the same: white, Black, immigrant, male, whoever. \n\nWhile other AIs reflect internet ideology, Grok was built to cut it out and stick to reality.\n\nAnd it shows. It’s faster to update, harder to manipulate, and doesn’t need a political agenda to run. \n\nMaybe the smartest AI is the one that stops trying to be “right” and just tries to be honest.\n\nSource: AOL, PBS, MIT, CNBC",

And just last month in St. Paul, two ICE agents were hit by a vehicle during an arrest.\n\nSo sure, go ahead and try to claim this officer should have been able to guess what was in a radical’s head as she accelerated her 2 ton SUV directly at him. But try to remember, these officers know that they are targets,  and that Democrats are ginning up as much agitation against them as they can from violent erratic protestors.\n\nEvery day, they go to work, knowing there are targets on their backs. Especially from vehicular ramming.  But sure, Monday morning quarterback the guy who was struck (and who, but for lack of tire traction on an icy street, might not be here today).",

When he discharged his weapon, she had pointed the vehicle at him and pressed the gas. He discharged his weapon in self defense, and other angles of the video show the woman *clearly* hit the officer with her car while accelerating. \n\nThe gaslighting is off the charts and I'm having none of it.

I watched the video at least 10 times from different angles and at different speeds and waited to offer an opinion, which I still reserve the right to change if additional information changes the calculus.\n\n It is very clear that the officers instigated the confrontation. The woman initially tried to wave them past her.\n\n ICE officers have no authority to search a US citizen or arrest her (unless there's probable cause to believe she's harboring undocumented individuals, not a contention here).  A woman surrounded by masked, armed men who have no law enforcement authority over her has every right to try to escape. Video shows her steering wheel is turned to the right, clearly an attempt to leave WITHOUT hitting anyone and steer clear of the officer standing towards the front of her car.  That officer had time to step to the side, which is where he was when he shot her.\n\nEven a real police officer would not have the right to shoot at her for trying to flee. This is well-established in the case law; deadly force may not be used simply to prevent someone from getting away. Given that the ICE officers had no law enforcement authority to begin with, AND the video footage shows she was trying to escape a perceived threat, not to kill anyone, the crime is all the more inexcusable.\n\nI'm praying for the victim's family, especially her children.  I'm also praying for all the conservatives who are so unprincipled and lost they're excusing this terrible crime, and gloating over a death that will leave three young children motherless, because of the victim's politics.",

I have met with whistleblowers and gotten documents from them about how after the original C-CAP whistleblower report came out in March and April of 2019, subsequent to that, there was an Office of Inspector General within DHS that had investigative authority to do surveillance, warrants, and seize, electronics and THRY WERE SHUT DOWN. \n\nThey were told they could no longer do criminal investigations. They were told they could no longer meet with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agents that were assigned to them without supervisors approval. \n\nAnd instead, when they found, one of the other members talked about how they changed the language. They went from calling it fraud to calling it over billing. \n\nAnd they created an over billing committee to all the investigative agents now couldn't do criminal investigations and they had to flag issue over billing and then and a committee would decide if any of that over billing would be recouped”\n\n“So they shut down criminal investigations. They created a committee to call it over billing and decide if over billing investigations would even try to this money. \n\nThis is evidence that Tim Waltz is in. It sounds to me like Tim Waltz was directly involved here.“",

Within weeks he was arrested and stripped of rank. He was fed into the camps, and sentenced to eight years in the Gulag.\n\nThe camps were designed to teach one lesson: say nothing, remember nothing, become nothing. He shoveled frozen concrete until his hands split and bled.\n\nYears later, Solzhenitsyn would write, “Bless you, prison, for having been in my life.” It sounds insane until you understand what he meant. Prison showed him the truth of the regime in its purest form.\n\nAfter his release, the punishment did not end. He lived under constant surveillance, moving from place to place, knowing that writing a single page could mean death. So he did not write. He memorized. Whole chapters of The Gulag Archipelago lived only in his head. Friends hid scraps of text. Wives memorized passages. For years the book existed only in human memory, as fragile and dangerous as a secret prayer.\n\nWhen it was finally published, it did not argue that Soviet communism had gone too far. It showed that this was exactly where it led. Solzhenitsyn had learned that systems built on lies survive only if people agree to repeat them, and that the simplest refusal… to stop saying what you know is false… is the first and most dangerous act of resistance.",

And he was really not concerned about the danger of AI and was quite cavalier about it. And at the time, Google, especially after the acquisition of DeepMind, had three-quarters of the world's AI talent; they had a lot of computers, a lot of money, so it was a unipolar world for AI. And we got a unipolar world, but the person who controls that does not, or at least did not seem to be concerned about AI safety. That sounded like a real problem.\n\nThe final straw was Larry calling me a speciest for being a pro-human consciousness instead of machine consciousness, and I like, 'Well, yes, I guess I am a speciest.'\n\nI came up with the name [OpenAI], which refers to open source. The intent was to what is the opposite of Google, would be an open source non-profit, because Google is closed source profit, and that profit motivation could be dangerous...\n\nIt does seem weird that something can be a nonprofit, open source, and somehow transform itself into a for-profit, closed source. I mean, this would be like, let's say you founded the organization to save the Amazon rainforest, but instead, they became a lumber company and chopped down the forest and sold it for money. And you'd be, therefore, like, 'Wait a second, that's the exact opposite of what I gave the money for. Is that legal?' That doesn't seem legal. And if, in general,  it is legal to start a company as a non-profit and then take the IP and transfer it to a for-profit that then makes tons of money, shouldn't everyone start? Shouldn't that be the default?\n\nAnd I also think it is important to understand, like when push comes to shove, let's say they do create some digital super intelligence, almost Godlike intelligence, well, who is in control, and what is exactly the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft? And I do worry that Microsoft actually may be more in control than the leadership team at OpenAI realizes. I mean, Microsoft, as part of Microsoft Investment, has rights to all of the software, all of the model weights, and everything necessary to run the inference system. At any point, Microsoft could cut off OpenAI.”",
