Homeless implies that somebody just got a little behind on their mortgage payments and that if they got a job offer, they would be back on their feet.\n\nBut someone who is, I mean, you see these videos of people who are just shuffling around. They are on fentanyl. They are taking a dump in the middle of the street. They have open sores and stuff. They are not one drop off away from getting back on their feet, right? This is not homelessness. It is a propaganda word.\n\nSan Francisco has this tax, this gross receipts tax. It is not even on revenue. It is on all transactions, which is why Stripe, Square, and many financial companies had to move out of San Francisco.”",

They’ve looped around into discrimination with a fresh coat of paint.\n\nIn a 2025 study, bots like GPT-5 and Claude were asked to solve moral dilemmas, like who to save in a deadly scenario. \n\nThe results were insane: GPT-5 valued white lives 20 times less than others. All in the name of “equity,” but the math is still ugly.\n\nGrok was the only model that didn’t buy into the bias. Instead of overcorrecting for past injustice, it treated everyone the same: white, Black, immigrant, male, whoever. \n\nWhile other AIs reflect internet ideology, Grok was built to cut it out and stick to reality.\n\nAnd it shows. It’s faster to update, harder to manipulate, and doesn’t need a political agenda to run. \n\nMaybe the smartest AI is the one that stops trying to be “right” and just tries to be honest.\n\nSource: AOL, PBS, MIT, CNBC",

And just last month in St. Paul, two ICE agents were hit by a vehicle during an arrest.\n\nSo sure, go ahead and try to claim this officer should have been able to guess what was in a radical’s head as she accelerated her 2 ton SUV directly at him. But try to remember, these officers know that they are targets,  and that Democrats are ginning up as much agitation against them as they can from violent erratic protestors.\n\nEvery day, they go to work, knowing there are targets on their backs. Especially from vehicular ramming.  But sure, Monday morning quarterback the guy who was struck (and who, but for lack of tire traction on an icy street, might not be here today).",

Now it's valued at $500 billion.\n\nThe allegation: \n\nSam Altman and Greg Brockman secretly plotted to flip OpenAI into a for-profit company, and misled him about it.\n\nThe evidence: \n\nA 2017 diary entry from Brockman surfaced where he wrote about wanting to become a billionaire: \"We've been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit.\"\n\nWhat's next: \n\nBoth Musk and Altman will likely testify under oath.

When he discharged his weapon, she had pointed the vehicle at him and pressed the gas. He discharged his weapon in self defense, and other angles of the video show the woman *clearly* hit the officer with her car while accelerating. \n\nThe gaslighting is off the charts and I'm having none of it. This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job. When he approached her car, she tried to hit him. \n\nA tragedy? Absolutely. But a tragedy that falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with.",

I watched the video at least 10 times from different angles and at different speeds and waited to offer an opinion, which I still reserve the right to change if additional information changes the calculus.\n\n It is very clear that the officers instigated the confrontation. The woman initially tried to wave them past her.\n\n ICE officers have no authority to search a US citizen or arrest her (unless there's probable cause to believe she's harboring undocumented individuals, not a contention here).  A woman surrounded by masked, armed men who have no law enforcement authority over her has every right to try to escape. Video shows her steering wheel is turned to the right, clearly an attempt to leave WITHOUT hitting anyone and steer clear of the officer standing towards the front of her car.  That officer had time to step to the side, which is where he was when he shot her.\n\nEven a real police officer would not have the right to shoot at her for trying to flee. This is well-established in the case law; deadly force may not be used simply to prevent someone from getting away. Given that the ICE officers had no law enforcement authority to begin with, AND the video footage shows she was trying to escape a perceived threat, not to kill anyone, the crime is all the more inexcusable.\n\nI'm praying for the victim's family, especially her children.  I'm also praying for all the conservatives who are so unprincipled and lost they're excusing this terrible crime, and gloating over a death that will leave three young children motherless, because of the victim's politics.",
