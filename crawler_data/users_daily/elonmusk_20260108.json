        "text": "ELON MUSK: “The homeless industrial complex in California is really dark, man. The network of NGOs should be called something like drug zombie farmers. Homeless is the wrong word. Homeless implies that somebody just got a little behind on their mortgage payments and that if they got a job offer, they would be back on their feet.\n\nBut someone who is, I mean, you see these videos of people who are just shuffling around. They are on fentanyl. They are taking a dump in the middle of the street. They have open sores and stuff. They are not one drop off away from getting back on their feet, right? This is not homelessness. It is a propaganda word.\n\nSan Francisco has this tax, this gross receipts tax. It is not even on revenue. It is on all transactions, which is why Stripe, Square, and many financial companies had to move out of San Francisco.”",
