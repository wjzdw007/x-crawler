He allegedly stabbed a Danish 77-year-old man to death just before Christmas.\n\n🇩🇰🇸🇴",

Someone MUST go to prison for this.\n\n\"There are Somali couriers who come to the airport almost daily with $1,600,000 in cash in a luggage. That sounds a little suspicious, right?\"\n\n\"It was going on daily, and they were moving about $350 million a year in cash in their luggage out of Minneapolis airport and then traditionally or predominantly overseas.\"\n\n\"One of the routes that TSA saw the money go, it would go from Minneapolis to Europe, Europe to Dubai, often through Amsterdam. It was flagged for years. TSA was flagging these payments for years.\"\n\n\"They grew. They grew from $20, $30 million a year to $350 million a year in the last two years, 2024 and 2025.\"\n\n\"It was literally a foreign ATM taking cash out of the United States to foreign destinations. We don't know the reason why, but that is now under investigation by the FBI and HSI. People say, well, is this normal?!\" - @jsolomonReports \n\n📽️ @JustTheNews",

There have to be sensible controls on immigration. If there are criminals in Germany who are committing crimes and hurting people in Germany, they must be deported, and that's not happening. \n\nThen, there must also be freedom of speech, such that the people know what the truth is. If you do not have freedom of speech, you cannot be a democracy because the public cannot make an informed decision about their vote. In Germany right now, there are draconian laws, rules against freedom of expression, where even insulting a politician can get you prison time, which is insane. So, I like the fact that the AfD is in favor of freedom of speech. I like that the AfD is in favor of sensible immigration policies, and deportation of criminals. And I like the generally libertarian policies of the AfD.”\n\nFrom: WELT Economic Summit, January 28, 2025",

X treats these matters seriously and acts promptly. Let’s be clear: this is not about technical compliance. This is a political war against @elonmusk and free speech—nothing more.",

        "text": "Yesterday a quasi-judicial body in Italy fined @Cloudflare $17 million for failing to go along with their scheme to censor the Internet. The scheme, which even the EU has called concerning, required us within a mere 30 minutes of notification to fully censor from the Internet any sites a shadowy cabal of European media elites deemed against their interests. No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency. It required us to not just remove customers, but also censor our 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver meaning it risked blacking out any site on the Internet. And it required us not just to censor the content in Italy but globally. In other words, Italy insists a shadowy, European media cabal should be able to dictate what is and is not allowed online.\n\nThat, of course, is DISGUSTING and even before yesterday’s fine we had multiple legal challenges pending against the underlying scheme. We, of course, will now fight the unjust fine. Not just because it’s wrong for us but because it is wrong for democratic values.\n\nIn addition, we are considering the following actions: 1) discontinuing the millions of dollars in pro bono cyber security services we are providing the upcoming Milano-Cortina Olympics; 2) discontinuing Cloudflare’s Free cyber security services for any Italy-based users; 3) removing all servers from Italian cities; and 4) terminating all plans to build an Italian Cloudflare office or make any investments in the country.\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. While there are things I would handle differently than the current U.S. administration, I appreciate @JDVance taking a leadership role in recognizing this type of regulation is a fundamental unfair trade issue that also threatens democratic values. And in this case @ElonMusk is right: #FreeSpeech is critical and under attack from an out-of-touch cabal of very disturbed European policy makers.\n\nI will be in DC first thing next week to discuss this with U.S. administration officials and I’ll be meeting with the IOC in Lausanne shortly after to outline the risk to the Olympic Games if @Cloudflare withdraws our cyber security protection.\n\nIn the meantime, we remain happy to discuss this with Italian government officials who, so far, have been unwilling to engage beyond issuing fines. We believe Italy, like all countries, has a right to regulate the content on networks inside its borders. But they must do so following the Rule of Law and principles of Due Process. And Italy certainly has no right to regulate what is and is not allowed on the Internet in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Brazil, India or anywhere outside its borders.\n\nTHIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIGHT AND WE WILL WIN!!!",

They can calculate everything and defend nothing.\n\nLewis  saw that once we reject inherited moral law, we don’t become free.
