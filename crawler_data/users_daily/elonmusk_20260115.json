          "text": "Disclaimer: I had given early access to internal beta version of Grok 4.20\n\nIt found a new Bellman function for one of the problems I’d been working on with my student N. Alpay. \n\nThe problem reduces to identifying the pointwise maximal function U(p,q) under two constraints and understanding the behavior of U(p,0). \nIn our paper https://t.co/pgJw9MaEA1 we proved U(p,0)\\geq I(p), where I(p) is the Gaussian isoperimetric profile, I(p) ~ p\\sqrt{log(1/p)} as p ~ 0. \n\nAfter ~5 minutes, Grok 4.20 produced an explicit formula U(p,q) = E \\sqrt{q^2+\\tau}, where \\tau is the exit time of Brownian motion from (0,1) starting at p. This yields U(p,0)=E\\sqrt{\\tau} ~ p log(1/p) at p ~ 0, a square root improvement in the logarithmic factor.\n\nAny significance of this result? It will not tell you how to change the world tomorrow. Rather, it gives a small step toward understanding what is going on with averages of stochastic analogs of derivatives (quadratic variation) of Boolean functions: how small can they be? \n\nMore precisely, this gives a sharp lower bound on the L1 norm of the dyadic square function applied to indicator functions 1_A of sets A \\subset [0,1]. \nIn my previous tweet about Takagi function, we saw that the sharp lower bound on ||S_1(1_A)||_1 miraculously coincides with Takagi function of |A| which (surprisingly to me) is related to the Riemann hypothesis. Here, we obtain a sharp lower bound on ||S_2(1_A)||_1 given by E \\sqrt{\\tau}, where Brownian motion starts at |A|. This function belongs to the family of isoperimetric-type profiles, but unlike the fractal Takagi function, it is smooth and does not coincide with the Gaussian isoperimetric profile. \n\nFinally, in harmonic analysis it is known that the square function is not bounded in L^1. The question here was more about curiosity: how exactly does it blow up when tested on Boolean functions 1_A.  Previously, the best known lower bound was |A|(1-|A|) (Burkholder—Davis—Gandy). In our paper, we obtained |A| (1-|A|)\\sqrt{log(1/(|A|(1-|A|)))}. This new Grok’s Bellman function gives |A| (1-|A|) \\log(1/(|A|(1-|A|))) and this bound is actually sharp.",

This journalist knows the facts, was given the truth, and adamantly refuses to report it.\n\nHere are the facts:\n\nAt 6:50 PM CT, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted traffic stop in Minneapolis of an illegal alien from Venezuela who was released into the country by Joe Biden in 2022.\n\nIn an attempt to evade arrest, the subject fled the scene in his vehicle and crashed into a parked car. The subject then fled on foot. \n\nThe law enforcement officer caught up to the subject on foot and attempted to apprehend him when the subject began to resist and violently assault the officer. While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle.\n\nAs the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick.\n\nFearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg. \n\nAll three subjects ran back into the apartment and barricaded themselves inside.\n\nThe attacked officer and subject are both in the hospital. Both attackers are in custody.",

He was worth about $10 billion at the time of this writing.\"\n\nIn the epilogue: \n\"...If all of this were taking place, Musk, then in his mid-fifties, likely would be the richest man in the world and among its most powerful. He would be the majority shareholder in three public companies, and history would be preparing to smile broadly on what he had accomplished.\"\"\n\n11 years later, at 54 - worth over $700B\n\nAmazing prescience, given all the other tech distractions and Tesla/SpaceX uncertainty in 2015.
