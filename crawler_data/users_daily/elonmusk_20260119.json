        "text": "Here is Grok’s answer to your challenge @CathyYoung63 \n\nWhat percentage of people arrested by ICE agents are illegal aliens and what percentage are innocent citizens?\n\nGrok:\nAccording to data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and independent tracking by organizations like the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) and media outlets, ICE arrests overwhelmingly target non-citizens with immigration violations—commonly referred to as illegal aliens or undocumented immigrants. Reports indicate that over 328,000 people were arrested by ICE from January to mid-December 2025.\n\nWrongful arrests of U.S. citizens (who could be considered \"innocent\" in this context, as they are not subject to immigration enforcement) are rare but documented. Investigations have identified more than 170 confirmed cases of U.S. citizens being held by ICE agents in 2025, often due to errors in questioning citizenship status.\n\nOther sources report up to 674 arrests of individuals claiming or confirmed as U.S. citizens during the same period, though only about 121 were detained beyond initial arrest.\n\nUsing the higher estimate of 674 wrongful arrests out of approximately 328,000 total ICE arrests in 2025, this represents about 0.2% of arrests. The lower confirmed figure of 170 cases equates to roughly 0.05%. In either case, the percentage of \"innocent people\" (U.S. citizens wrongly arrested) is under 1%, while approximately 99.8-99.95% are non-citizens with immigration violations (illegal aliens). Note that ICE prioritizes arrests of non-citizens with criminal convictions or charges (about 70% of arrests), but the remaining 30% are typically non-criminal immigration violators—still classified as illegal aliens under U.S. law.",

We're far from the rest of the world. \n\nOur State Sponsored Media tells you that Australia has the best of everything in the world. That our culture and lifestyle is unmatched.\n\nBut as soon as you arrive in America it is blindingly obvious how false that is. America feels explosive, alive, chaotic, rich. It's loud, obnoxious, unapologetic.\n\nThere's no hint of tall poppy syndrome. And no constant nagging of the Nanny State. \n\nAmerica is accelerating into an unknown future without fear. \n\nThere are so many technological innovations here that would never see the light of day in Australia, because they would be strangled by regulation.\n\nAustralia is beautiful, sure. But it's safe, quiet, controlled. \n\nMedia and society tell you to conform, comply, be seen and not heard. Take the safe option. Be fearful of new things. Be fearful of the future.\n\nThe spark of innovation is stifled. The light of creativity is discouraged. The warmth of the collective is more important than the rugged individual.\n\nAnd as time goes on, one of the two countries is going to be left behind. It's pretty clear which country that is.\n\nSo, it's terrifying. \n\nAnd before I came here, everyone said I should be terrified of America. That I wouldn't be let it the country. That everyone is rioting. That Hitler runs the country. \n\nThat couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nTheir brains have been absolutely fried by Australian State Sponsored media.",

Your housing is going to cost less. Everything is going to cost less.\"\n\nHe explains this will happen through robots farming coffee more efficiently and better supply chain management, meaning people will need less money.\n\nSecond, people will opt out of the economy.\n\n\"They're going to work fewer hours. They're going to work fewer days a week, and they're going to work fewer years. They're going to retire earlier because they're going to be able to support their lifestyle working less.\"\n\nThird, entirely new jobs and industries will emerge.\n\nJonathan points to history as evidence:\n\n\"Think about 100 years ago. 98% of the workforce in the United States was in agriculture. When we were able to reduce that to 2%, we found things for those other 98% of the population to do.\"\n\nHe continues:\n\n\"The jobs that are going to exist 100 years from now, we can't even contemplate.\"\n\nSoftware developers didn't exist a century ago. In another century, they won't exist either, \"because everyone's going to be vibe coding.\"\n\nThe same applies to influencers, a career that would have been unthinkable 100 years ago but now earns people millions.\n\nHis conclusion: deflationary pressure, workforce opt-outs, and new industries we can't yet imagine will combine to create one outcome...\n\n\"We're not going to have enough people.\"",
