The full code is live on GitHub and will be refreshed every 4 weeks.\n\nYour feed blends posts from accounts you follow with posts discovered across all of 𝕏, then ranks them using a Grok based transformer that predicts how likely you are to like, reply, repost, click, or watch. Instead of one simple score, the model predicts many actions and combines them for a more nuanced ranking.\n\nEverything learns directly from user behavior. Intelligence lives inside the model, not scattered pipelines. The system is modular, transparent, and stable, with each post scored independently so results are cacheable and consistent.\n\nThis is one of the most open looks ever at a large scale social feed ranking system.",

Today the German government is finally admitting he was right\n\nChancellor Friedrich Merz has officially labeled the decision to shut down Germany’s nuclear plants a 'huge mistake,' confessing that the move has crippled the economy and left the country with the most expensive energy transition in the world\n\n(What Elon warned 3 years ago:)\nI think it's very important that Germany not shut down its nuclear power stations? I think this is extremely crazy\n\nI want to be super clear. My opinion is Germany should not only not shut down the nuclear power plants, it should reopen the ones that shut down. Those are the fastest ones to restart. It's crazy to shut down nuclear power plants\n\nEspecially if you're in a place where there are no natural disasters. If you're somewhere with severe earthquakes or tsunamis, it's more of a question mark\n\n But if there's not a massive natural disaster risk which Germany does not have then there's really no danger with the nuclear power plants",

Prioritize the needs of these millions of non-citizens over the needs of the American citizen, with free flights, buses, hotels, meals and phones, ensuring their loyalty to the political party that imported them\n\n3. Keep them in the country at all costs, even when they commit violent crime like murder and rape. Attack the language used to describe the criminals, as opposed to the criminals themselves. Slander critics as racist\n\n4. Ensure their privileges are made irrevocable with city and state sanctuary laws that act as population magnets. Codify permanent status and ensure non-cooperation with ICE\n\n5. Count the non-citizens in the census that will determine congressional apportionment in the House of Representatives. As of now, that would equal 13 extra congressional districts a tremendous amount of electoral power\n\n6. Wage a massive, heavily funded lawfare campaign to change state voting laws that legalize mass mail-in ballots, no signature verification, and no proof of citizenship requirements, making it nearly impossible to prove voter fraud\n\n7. Lock in the permanent voting majority with campaign promises of lavish benefits and permanent privileges, enshrining generational fealty to the Democrat Party\n\n8. Win elections\n\n9. Entrenched single-party rule has been achieved\n\nThe best part? Your tax dollars are paying for it",
