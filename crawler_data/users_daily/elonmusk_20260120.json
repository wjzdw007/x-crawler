The full code is live on GitHub and will be refreshed every 4 weeks.\n\nYour feed blends posts from accounts you follow with posts discovered across all of 𝕏, then ranks them using a Grok based transformer that predicts how likely you are to like, reply, repost, click, or watch. Instead of one simple score, the model predicts many actions and combines them for a more nuanced ranking.\n\nEverything learns directly from user behavior. Intelligence lives inside the model, not scattered pipelines. The system is modular, transparent, and stable, with each post scored independently so results are cacheable and consistent.\n\nThis is one of the most open looks ever at a large scale social feed ranking system.",
