We can't let RINOs stand in the way of election integrity under President Trump.\n\n**Tell @ChuckGrassley to SUPPORT the SAVE Act IMMEDIATELY!**\n\n- **Washington D.C. Office Phone:** (202) 224-3744  \n- **Fax:** (202) 224-6020  \n- **Online Contact Form:** https://t.co/zL2mCWEHSE (Fill it out and demand he back the SAVE Act!)  \n- **Official Website:** https://t.co/vFnSPcOUjh\n\nCall, email, fax—make your voice heard LOUD and CLEAR! Let him know Iowa voters (and patriots nationwide) won't stand for this betrayal. Hold him accountable!\n\nTag him everywhere: @ChuckGrassley @GrassleyPress\n\n#SAVEAct #ElectionIntegrity #CallGrassley #MAGA #AmericaFirst 🇺🇸",
