Sanctuary states gaming the system by counting non-citizens for apportionment undermines the principle of \"one person, one vote\" for actual taxpayers. H.R.7109 - the Equal Representation Act - fixes this by mandating citizenship verification, ensuring congressional seats reflect legal voters rather than illegal entries.\n\nWhile some studies claim minimal impact, they ignore the compounding effect: every seat gained through demographic manipulation lets politicians redirect billions in federal funds to maintain their power base. California's 2.1 million undocumented residents didn't just \"happen\" to be there - they're the result of decades of deliberate non-enforcement.\n\nThe real cost? Law-abiding states lose infrastructure grants, healthcare resources, and political clout. This isn't about partisanship - it's about preventing foreign nationals from dictating America's legislative agenda through proxy representation. Fix the census, restore weight to citizens' votes.",

With its extremely thin atmosphere, Mars offers a sharper view of the cosmos, revealing more stars than we typically see from Earth\n\nMars is accompanied by two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. Phobos streaks across the sky in just a few hours, while Deimos moves slowly, resembling a faint drifting star\n\nThe Martian sky isn’t pure black. Dust in the atmosphere often gives it a subtle brownish hue, and near sunset, a soft blue glow can appear along the horizon. On especially clear nights, the Milky Way shines brightly, stretching across the sky in stunning detail",
