Sanctuary states gaming the system by counting non-citizens for apportionment undermines the principle of \"one person, one vote\" for actual taxpayers. H.R.7109 - the Equal Representation Act - fixes this by mandating citizenship verification, ensuring congressional seats reflect legal voters rather than illegal entries.\n\nWhile some studies claim minimal impact, they ignore the compounding effect: every seat gained through demographic manipulation lets politicians redirect billions in federal funds to maintain their power base. California's 2.1 million undocumented residents didn't just \"happen\" to be there - they're the result of decades of deliberate non-enforcement.\n\nThe real cost? Law-abiding states lose infrastructure grants, healthcare resources, and political clout. This isn't about partisanship - it's about preventing foreign nationals from dictating America's legislative agenda through proxy representation. Fix the census, restore weight to citizens' votes.",

With its extremely thin atmosphere, Mars offers a sharper view of the cosmos, revealing more stars than we typically see from Earth\n\nMars is accompanied by two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. Phobos streaks across the sky in just a few hours, while Deimos moves slowly, resembling a faint drifting star\n\nThe Martian sky isn’t pure black. Dust in the atmosphere often gives it a subtle brownish hue, and near sunset, a soft blue glow can appear along the horizon. On especially clear nights, the Milky Way shines brightly, stretching across the sky in stunning detail",

No one has ever achieved full reusability of a rocket, which is very important for the cost of access to space.\n\nWe've achieved partial re usability with Falcon 9. We've now landed the boost stage over 500 times, but we have to throw away the upper stage. The upper stage burns up on reentry and the cost of that is equivalent to a small to medium sized jet.\n\nSo with Starship, which is a giant rocket, it's the largest flying machine ever made, we should prove full reusability, which will be a profound invention, because the cost of access to space will drop by a factor of 100 when you achieve full reusability. So it makes putting large satellites into space very low, very cheap.\"",

And if that's the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished\n\nThe image in my mind is of a tiny candle in a vast darkness. A tiny candle of consciousness that could easily go out\n\nAnd that's why it's important to make life multi-planetary, such that if there is a natural disaster or a man-made disaster on Earth, that consciousness continues\n\nThat's the purpose of SpaceX\"",
