They were hands-off for the entire trip, including charging stops. It took 58 hours and 22 minutes at an average speed of 64 mph.\n\nThe whole trip was caught on camera, and the video will be released soon.",

Once an autonomous vehicle is mature, most human input is an error.\n\nA comedy of human errors added hours and hundreds of miles, but FSD stunned us with its consistent and comfortable behavior.\n\nMUCH more (hilarious) detail to follow.\n\nThank you to my co-passengers @dackboor & Paul Pham, Tesla experts/enthusiasts who agreed to do this in the worst weather possible.\n\nCongrats to @aelluswamy and team for this incredible step forward.\n\nData, pix and video coming soon.\n\n1/x\n\nhttps://t.co/d2gaScrwdT @elonmusk @Scobleizer @wholemars @itskyleconner @SawyerMerritt @alex_avoigt @DavidMoss",
