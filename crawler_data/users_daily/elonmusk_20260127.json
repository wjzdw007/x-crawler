Where were rapists in Sweden born?\n\nThe largest group was born outside of Sweden, followed by those born inside Sweden with both parents born in Sweden. \n\nThe former finding doesn't make much sense, since they're such a small part of the population, but the latter does, since they're the overwhelming majority of the population.\n\nSo let's look into these slices. \n\nFirst up: the 5.7% of rapists born in Sweden with one parent from Sweden. We're going to look at where their parent born outside Sweden was from.\n\nTheir dominant source? Other Western Countries.\n\nNow what about the 5.8% of the rapists born in Sweden who had two parents born outside of Sweden?\n\nThey were considerably less Western than those with one Swedish-born parent. \n\nOnto the final and most numerous group: rapists born outside Sweden.\n\nNow that we know their demographics, let's check some other details. Per the paper, we know that \n\n- 32.5% received social welfare\n- 37.3% had low education\n- They scored 0.5 d below the mean for resilience\n- They scored 0.6 d below the mean for IQ\n- They scored 0.95 d below the mean for school achievement\n \nIn terms of prior convictions, 46.1% had committed a violent crime and 36.8% had committed a property crime. 15.9% had a psychiatric disorder and 19.3% had an alcohol use disorder, while 21% had a drug use disorder.\n\nTheir parents were little better: 0.5% of the sample had at least one rapist parent, 16.2% had a white collar criminal parent, 26.4% had a property criminal parent, and 18.6% had a violent criminal as a parent. 24.5% had parents with psychiatric disorders, and 9.4% had parents with histories of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nWith all of that said, the majority of the rapists were still classified as a priori low-risk.\n\n You can check out the study this data is from here: https://t.co/sPeaBOjtEl",
