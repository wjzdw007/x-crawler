I think the case is a no-brainer for building AI, solar-powered AI data centers in space because, as you mentioned, it's also very cold in space. If you're in the shadow, then it's very cold in space, just 3 degrees Kelvin.\n\nSo you just have your solar panels facing the Sun and then a radiator that's like pointed away from the Sun, so it has no Sun incidence and then it's just cooling. It's a very efficient cooling system. \n\nSo the net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be space and that'll be true within two years, maybe three, three at the latest.”",

The first time I met him was in San Francisco around 11pm. He had already spent the entire day working at Tesla and then went straight to Twitter headquarters. It was late, but he was still fully focused and working. Months later, in October, I visited him again. It was late evening on a weekend, and once again, he was working. No breaks, no downtime. He was even working on his birthday. Last month, when I met him again, it was a Sunday evening and he was deep into xAI work.\n\nThis has been consistent for years. Seven days a week. He is driven by a mission to make humanity multi planetary. He understands the urgency and believes we are running out of time. Even with all the money in the world, he does not take vacations, does not own a yacht, and does not live in some fancy mansion. He lives simply, loves his work, and stays extremely disciplined. So anyone saying he had time to party on an island is telling a blatant lie.",
