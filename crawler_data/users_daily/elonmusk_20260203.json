        "text": "BREAKING: SpaceX and xAI have just formerly announced that they are merging.\n\nFull statement from Elon Musk: \"SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform. This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\n\nCurrent advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial data centers, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment.\n\nIn the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale. To harness even a millionth of our Sun’s energy would require over a million times more energy than our civilization currently uses!\n\nThe only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space. I mean, space is called “space” for a reason. 😂\n\nBy directly harnessing near-constant solar power with little operating or maintenance costs, these satellites will transform our ability to scale compute. It’s always sunny in space! Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization, one that can harness the Sun’s full power, while supporting AI-driven applications for billions of people today and ensuring humanity’s multi-planetary future.\n\nIn the history of spaceflight, there has never been a vehicle capable of launching the megatons of mass that space-based data centers or permanent bases on the Moon and cities on Mars require. Even in 2025, the most prolific year in history in terms of the number of orbital launches, only about 3000 tons of payload was launched into orbit, primarily consisting of Starlink satellites carried by our Falcon rocket.\n\nThe requirement to launch thousands of satellites to orbit became a forcing function for the Falcon program, driving recursive improvements to reach the unprecedented flight rates necessary to make space-based internet a reality. This year, Starship will begin delivering the much more powerful V3 Starlink satellites to orbit, with each launch adding more than 20 times the capacity to the constellation as the current Falcon launches of the V2 Starlink satellites. Starship will also launch the next generation of direct-to-mobile satellites, which will deliver full cellular coverage everywhere on Earth.\n\nWhile the need to launch these satellites will act as a similar forcing function to drive Starship improvements and launch rates, the sheer number of satellites that will be needed for space-based data centers will push Starship to even greater heights. With launches every hour carrying 200 tons per flight, Starship will deliver millions of tons to orbit and beyond per year, enabling an exciting future where humanity is out exploring amongst the stars.\n\nThe basic math is that launching a million tons per year of satellites generating 100 kW of compute power per ton would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, with no ongoing operational or maintenance needs. Ultimately, there is a path to launching 1 TW/year from Earth.\n\nMy estimate is that within 2 to 3 years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space. This cost-efficiency alone will enable innovative companies to forge ahead in training their AI models and processing data at unprecedented speeds and scales, accelerating breakthroughs in our understanding of physics and invention of technologies to benefit humanity.\n\nThis new constellation will build upon the well-established space sustainability design and operational strategies, including end-of-life disposal, that have proven successful for SpaceX’s existing broadband satellite systems.\n\nWhile launching AI satellites from Earth is the immediate focus, Starship’s capabilities will also enable operations on other worlds. Thanks to advancements like in-space propellant transfer, Starship will be capable of landing massive amounts of cargo on the Moon. Once there, it will be possible to establish a permanent presence for scientific and manufacturing pursuits. Factories on the Moon can take advantage of lunar resources to manufacture satellites and deploy them further into space. By using an electromagnetic mass driver and lunar manufacturing, it is possible to put 500 to 1000 TW/year of AI satellites into deep space, meaningfully ascend the Kardashev scale and harness a non-trivial percentage of the Sun’s power.\n\nThe capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe.\n\nThank you for everything you have done and will do for the light cone of consciousness.\"",

Terrestrial data centers can't scale fast enough without \"imposing hardship on communities and the environment.\"\n\nThe solution? Put the data centers in space.\n\n● Launch 1 million satellites generating 100 kW of compute power per ton\n● Add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually\n● No ongoing operational or maintenance costs\n● Always sunny in space ☀️\n\nElon Musk estimates that within 2-3 years, space will be the cheapest place to run AI compute.\n\nThe bigger picture:\n\nStarship will launch every hour, carrying 200 tons per flight, delivering millions of tons to orbit annually. Eventually, lunar factories using electromagnetic mass drivers could deploy 500-1000 terawatts of AI satellites into deep space, a serious step toward becoming a Kardashev II civilization.\n\nThe combined company now controls: rockets, satellite internet, direct-to-cell communications, the X platform, and cutting-edge AI.\n\nOne company. Earth to Mars. Atoms to intelligence.\nAd Astra.",

The same platform that the EU is fining for 120 million euros under the DSA and the same platform that is currently having its offices raided in France. \n\nThis is the type of stuff over which governments should resign and institutions like the EU should fall. Democracy is dead. \n\nAbolish the EU! Now!",

If an algorithm happens to show a truth that makes the ruling party look bad, it’s a \"criminal offense.\"\n\nUnder the pretext of \"protecting the children,\" Spain is banning anyone under 16 from social media and demanding \"real barriers\" for age verification. This is a massive Trojan Horse for a National Digital ID. To \"save the kids,\" Sánchez is effectively demanding that every Spanish citizen hand over their private biometric or legal data just to scroll a feed.\n\nHe has also vowed to make platform executives like Elon Musk legally accountable for what users post, effectively holding tech leaders’ personal freedom hostage. It’s a transparent attempt to force Silicon Valley (and Austin) to build \"kill switches\" for any content the Spanish government doesn't like.\n\nSánchez dropped the mask at the end, specifically naming Grok, the one AI committed to the unvarnished truth, alongside TikTok and Instagram for investigation.",

        "text": "French judicial authorities raided X’s Paris office today in connection with a politicized criminal investigation into alleged manipulation of algorithms and purported fraudulent data extraction. We are disappointed by this development, but we are not surprised. The Paris Public Prosecutor’s office widely publicized the raid—making clear that today’s action was an abusive act of law enforcement theater designed to achieve illegitimate political objectives rather than advance legitimate law enforcement goals rooted in the fair and impartial administration of justice.\n\nThe Paris Public Prosecutor's Office is plainly attempting to exert pressure on X’s senior management in the United States by targeting our French entity and employees, who are not the focus of this investigation. The Prosecutor’s Office has ignored the established procedural mechanisms to obtain evidence in compliance with international treaties and X’s rights to defend itself. These procedural mechanisms are well known and used on a daily basis by judicial authorities around the world.\n\nThe allegations underlying today’s raid are baseless and X categorically denies any wrongdoing. Today’s staged raid reinforces our conviction that this investigation distorts French law, circumvents due process, and endangers free speech. X is committed to defending its fundamental rights and the rights of its users.  We will not be intimidated by the actions of French judicial authorities today. \n___________________\nLes autorités judiciaires françaises ont perquisitionné ce jour les bureaux parisiens de X dans le cadre d'une enquête pénale reposant sur des motivations politiques et faisant suite à des allégations de manipulation d'algorithmes et de prétendues extractions frauduleuses de données. Nous sommes déçus par ce développement mais il ne nous surprend pas. Le parquet de Paris a donné un large écho médiatique à cette mesure, démontrant ainsi qu’elle constitue un acte judiciaire abusif visant à atteindre des objectifs politiques illégitimes plutôt qu’à favoriser la plus juste application de la loi dans le respect d’une administration loyale et impartiale de la justice.\n\nLe parquet de Paris tente manifestement d’exercer une pression sur la direction générale de X aux Etats-Unis en visant notre entité française, étrangère aux faits poursuivis, ainsi que ses employés, au mépris des mécanismes procéduraux établis par les traités internationaux leur permettant de collecter des preuves ainsi que du droit de X de se défendre. Ces mécanismes et véhicules procéduraux sont parfaitement connus et utilisés quotidiennement par les autorités judiciaires du monde entier.\n\nLes allégations ayant justifié cette perquisition sont infondées et X réfute catégoriquement avoir commis la moindre infraction. Cette mise en scène ne fait que renforcer sa conviction que cette enquête viole le droit français, constitue un détournement de procédure et porte atteinte à la liberté d'expression. X est déterminée à défendre ses droits fondamentaux ainsi que ceux de ses utilisateurs.  Nous ne nous laisserons pas intimider par les mesures mises en œuvre aujourd'hui par les autorités judiciaires françaises.",
