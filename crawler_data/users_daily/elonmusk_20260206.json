They don't say, 'Please keep the fraud going.' They’re like, 'You're killing baby pandas!'\n\n\"Meanwhile, there's no baby pandas who are dying. They're just making it up. The fraudsters are capable of coming up with extremely compelling, heart-wrenching stories that are false — but nonetheless sound sympathetic. That's what happened.\"\n\n@DailyCaller",
