Just seemed too conspiratorial to me and not interesting.\n\nBut after seeing all of the polling coming out showing overwhelming bipartisan consensus on voter ID laws, and still seeing big Dems push their “voter ID laws are racist” propaganda, it’s hard for me to ignore. It’s extremely odd to me how hard some Dems are pushing this agenda when almost none of their constituents want it. Why? If not to do something fraudulent, I don’t understand why. It’s obvious that most Americans don’t agree with their reasoning, but they are still trying for it. \n\nInsanely shady. Can’t think of any reason other than a desire to do something fraudulent. Nobody thinks voter ID laws are racist. It’s honestly way more racist to argue that minorities shouldn’t be expected to produce identification. Offensive af.",

Fisker Automotive got ~$529M (later defaulted), and Vehicle Production Group ~$50M.\n\nTransparency on full display—big legacy automakers got far bigger slices.",
